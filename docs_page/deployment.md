# Deployment

Running ARC-1 for more than one person — shared team server, BTP Cloud Foundry, or a hosted instance that multiple MCP clients hit.

For single-developer setups on your own laptop, use [local-development.md](local-development.md) instead.

## Decision tree

**Who authenticates to SAP?**

| Answer | SAP auth to pick | Per-user SAP audit? |
|---|---|---|
| Everyone shares a service account | Basic Auth | ❌ Shared identity |
| Destination Service resolves it (on-prem via Cloud Connector) | BTP Destination | Depends on destination type |
| Destination uses `PrincipalPropagation` + Cloud Connector | **Principal Propagation** | ✅ Per-user |
| BTP CF app connects to BTP ABAP Environment | Destination `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` | ✅ Per-user |
| BTP CF app connects to S/4HANA Public Cloud (developer extensibility) | Destination `SAMLAssertion` (same as BAS) | ✅ Per-user (PP only) |
| Local developer connects to BTP ABAP Environment | BTP service-key OAuth + browser login | ✅ One local user; not headless |

**Who authenticates to ARC-1 (the MCP endpoint)?**

| Answer | MCP auth to pick |
|---|---|
| Everyone shares one token | API Key |
| IdP-issued JWT (Entra ID, Okta, Keycloak, Cognito, …) | OIDC |
| Running on BTP CF with XSUAA | XSUAA OAuth |
| Mix of the above | All three — they chain, see [enterprise-auth.md](enterprise-auth.md#coexistence-matrix) |

**Where does ARC-1 run?**

| Answer | Path |
|---|---|
| Docker on any VM / container host | [Docker deployment](#docker-on-any-vm) |
| BTP Cloud Foundry, one on-prem SAP target | [BTP CF with PP](#btp-cloud-foundry-with-principal-propagation) |
| BTP Cloud Foundry, many on-prem SAP system/clients | [Multi-System Setup](multi-target-setup.md) |
| BTP Cloud Foundry, BTP ABAP backend | [BTP CF + BTP ABAP](#btp-cloud-foundry-btp-abap-environment) |
| BTP Cloud Foundry, S/4HANA Public Cloud backend | [S/4HANA Public Cloud (PP via SAMLAssertion)](s4hana-public-cloud.md) |

## Docker on any VM

Run the published image on any host with Docker. Works for on-prem SAP reachable from the host, or BTP ABAP if the host can route to `*.abap.*.hana.ondemand.com`.

### Shared service account + API Key

```bash
docker run -d --name arc1 -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:44300 \
  -e SAP_USER=SVC_ARC1 -e SAP_PASSWORD=... \
  -e SAP_CLIENT=100 \
  -e ARC1_API_KEYS="$(openssl rand -hex 32):admin" \
  -e SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true \
  -e SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='Z*,$TMP' \
  ghcr.io/arc-mcp/arc-1:latest
```

MCP clients pass `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>` when connecting to `http://host:8080/mcp`.

### Shared service account + per-user OIDC

Adds per-user identity on top of ARC-1 (Layer A) while still sharing one SAP user (Layer B):

```bash
docker run -d --name arc1 -p 8080:8080 \
  -e SAP_URL=https://your-sap-host:44300 \
  -e SAP_USER=SVC_ARC1 -e SAP_PASSWORD=... \
  -e SAP_OIDC_ISSUER=https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/v2.0 \
  -e SAP_OIDC_AUDIENCE={client-id-guid} \
  ghcr.io/arc-mcp/arc-1:latest
```

This example only turns on OIDC validation for the MCP endpoint. It does **not** widen the server's safety ceiling: ARC-1 still defaults to read-only, no SQL, no named table preview, no transport writes, and writes restricted to `$TMP` unless you set explicit `SAP_ALLOW_*` safety flags.

If this shared server should allow development work, add these flags to the same `docker run` command:

```bash
-e SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=true \
-e SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES='Z*,$TMP'
```

Per-user JWT scopes and API-key profiles sit **beneath** that server ceiling — they can only tighten, never widen. A user with the `write` scope still cannot mutate objects when `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=false`. Full model: [authorization.md](authorization.md#capability-requirements). Every flag: [configuration-reference.md](configuration-reference.md).

ARC-1 audit logs show the real MCP user; SAP audit logs show the shared service account. Trade-off — good compromise when you can't use PP.
For this shared-user mode, ARC-1 runs a startup auth preflight (`/sap/bc/adt/core/discovery`) and blocks SAP tool calls on 401/403 with a clear remediation message. This avoids hammering SAP with repeated failed logins when the technical password/client is wrong.

## BTP Cloud Foundry with Principal Propagation

The recommended deployment path for per-user SAP identity with on-premise SAP. XSUAA identifies the
MCP user; Destination and Connectivity services plus Cloud Connector propagate that identity;
SAP certificate mapping and authorization decide the final access.

If you have not chosen between single-target, multi-target, BTP ABAP, or S/4HANA Public Cloud yet,
start with the [SAP BTP documentation map](btp-overview.md).

### You'll need

- BTP subaccount with a Cloud Foundry space
- Cloud Connector installed in your network, mapping your on-prem SAP
- BTP Destination Service with a destination of type `HTTP` + authentication `PrincipalPropagation`
- BTP XSUAA for MCP client auth
- Optional: BTP Audit Log Service

### Shape

```
MCP client (user JWT) → XSUAA validates → ARC-1 on CF
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                    Destination Service (PP)
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                     Cloud Connector
                                              │
                                              ▼
                                   On-prem SAP (real user)
```

### Config

Use the repository MTA and a customer-owned extension rather than a sequence of untracked
`cf set-env` commands:

```yaml
modules:
  - name: arc1-mcp-server
    properties:
      SAP_BTP_DESTINATION: "MY_SAP_STARTUP"
      SAP_BTP_PP_DESTINATION: "MY_SAP_PP"
      SAP_PP_ENABLED: "true"
      SAP_PP_STRICT: "true"
```

This first deployment remains read-only. Prove PP identity and safe reads before enabling data, SQL,
writes, transports, Git, or broader package patterns as separate approvals.

!!! warning "Principal propagation fails closed by default"
    With `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true`, JWT principal-propagation failures return an error instead of falling back to the shared service account. Separate strict PP and API-key instances are recommended, but one mixed instance is supported with explicit `SAP_PP_STRICT=false`; API-key calls then use the shared SAP identity. See [Principal Propagation Setup](principal-propagation-setup.md).

Startup summary:

```
INFO: auth: MCP=[xsuaa] SAP=pp (per-user)
```

## BTP Cloud Foundry + BTP ABAP Environment

ARC-1 deployed on CF, backend is a BTP ABAP (Steampunk) system. No Cloud Connector needed — both sides are on BTP.

SAP auth is **OAuth2 via a BTP Destination with `OAuth2UserTokenExchange`**. The ABAP service key is used to create the destination's OAuth client settings, but it is not mounted into ARC-1 and ARC-1 does not run the local browser flow. Per request, XSUAA authenticates the MCP user, the Destination service exchanges that user token for an ABAP-context bearer token, and SAP sees the real ABAP user.

```bash
cf create-service xsuaa application arc1-xsuaa -c xs-security.json
cf create-service destination lite arc1-destination
# Create destination ABAP_PP with Authentication=OAuth2UserTokenExchange
cf set-env arc1-mcp-server SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE btp
cf set-env arc1-mcp-server SAP_XSUAA_AUTH true
cf set-env arc1-mcp-server SAP_PP_ENABLED true
cf set-env arc1-mcp-server SAP_PP_STRICT true
cf set-env arc1-mcp-server SAP_BTP_DESTINATION ABAP_PP
```

## Hardening checklist

For any deployment visible to a network, before you open the gate:

!!! danger "The safety ceiling is your prompt-injection backstop"
    ARC-1 feeds SAP-resident content (source, comments, error text) to the LLM, which then issues the next tool calls under the user's identity — a poisoned ABAP comment is an attack. `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=false` and a tight `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES` are the controls that hold *regardless of what the model decides*; enabling writes or `*` is a deliberate risk decision, not a convenience.

- [ ] TLS terminated by a reverse proxy or platform (never HTTP on a public port)
- [ ] `ARC1_API_KEYS` or OIDC / XSUAA configured — never run HTTP mode without Layer A auth
- [ ] `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=false` unless you've deliberately enabled writes
- [ ] `SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES` set to a specific allowlist, not `*`
- [ ] `SAP_ALLOW_DATA_PREVIEW=false` and `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=false` unless you need them
- [ ] `SAP_ALLOW_TRANSPORT_WRITES=false` unless you need CTS management
- [ ] `SAP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES=false` unless you need gCTS/abapGit writes (reads are always allowed when the backends are available)
- [ ] PP/API-key topology is explicit: recommended strict/separate instances, or supported mixed mode with `SAP_PP_STRICT=false`
- [ ] `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT` set (e.g. `60`) for multi-user instances — the per-user MCP quota is **off by default**, so one runaway agent loop can saturate the shared SAP request semaphore
- [ ] `SAP_INSECURE=false` (the default) — the bundled `manifest.yml` / `mta.yaml` ship `"false"`; keep it that way on CA-signed landscapes
- [ ] If using cookies: `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` and cookies both set? → refuses unless `SAP_PP_ALLOW_SHARED_COOKIES=true` escape hatch is explicit
- [ ] Audit log sink configured (file or BTP Audit Log Service) — payload bodies and result previews are centrally redacted, but logs still contain identities, paths, statuses, sizes, and timing metadata; restrict permissions and rotation
- [ ] `ARC1_CACHE=memory`/`none` or an encrypted volume on IP-sensitive landscapes — the SQLite cache stores SAP source in cleartext at `.arc1-cache.db`
- [ ] Image pinned to an exact version (for example `:0.10.0`), not `:latest` <!-- x-release-please-version -->
- [ ] Update procedure rehearsed → [updating.md](updating.md)

## Coexistence rules

ARC-1 fails fast at startup on unsafe combinations. See the [Coexistence Matrix](enterprise-auth.md#coexistence-matrix) for the full table. The ones that most often bite:

| Combo | Result |
|---|---|
| `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` + `SAP_COOKIE_FILE` / `SAP_COOKIE_STRING` | ❌ startup error (unless `SAP_PP_ALLOW_SHARED_COOKIES=true`) |
| `SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY` + cookies | ❌ startup error |
| `SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY` + `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` | ❌ startup error |
| `SAP_DISABLE_SAML=true` + BTP | ⚠️ warning, continues (will break BTP ABAP / S/4 Public Cloud) |
