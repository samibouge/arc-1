# ARC-1 Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-07-31 (SEC-15 durable DCR signing-key lifecycle research)

**Project:** ARC-1 (ABAP Relay Connector) — MCP Server for SAP ABAP Systems
**Repository:** https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1

> **Note on file paths:** dated entries below reference the codebase as it was when written. The
> former `src/handlers/intent.ts` monolith was split into per-tool modules (`read.ts`, `write.ts`,
> `dispatch.ts`, …) in [#402](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/402) — see
> [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for the current file map.

## Vision

Every other SAP MCP server today runs on the developer's local machine — unmanaged, unaudited, with whatever permissions the developer happens to have. There is no admin oversight, no token budget control, no audit trail, and no way to restrict what an LLM can do to an SAP system.

**ARC-1 is different.** It is a **centralized, admin-controlled MCP gateway** deployed on BTP Cloud Foundry or a company server (Docker). One target per instance remains the default; the experimental BTP multi-target mode is a narrowly reviewed, read-only exception. The admin controls which tools are exposed, which packages can be touched, and whether writes are allowed — before any LLM request reaches SAP.

## Priority & Effort Legends

### Priority Legend

| Priority | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| P0 | Critical — blocks enterprise adoption |
| P1 | High — significant value, should do next |
| P2 | Medium — nice to have, plan for later |
| P3 | Low — future consideration |

### Effort Legend

| Effort | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| XS | < 1 day |
| S | 1-2 days |
| M | 3-5 days |
| L | 1-2 weeks |
| XL | 2-4 weeks |

## Overview: Not Yet Implemented (sorted by priority)

<!--
SORT RULES for this table — DO NOT BREAK when adding rows:
1. Open items first, sorted by priority (P0 → P1 → P2 → P3), then by ascending
   effort (XS → S → M → L → XL) within each priority — smallest effort on top.
2. Completed (strikethrough) rows go at the BOTTOM, also sorted by priority (P0 → P3).
3. Each ID cell links to its detail anchor below, e.g. `[FEAT-18](#feat-18)`.
4. When you complete an item: strike it, move to the completed block at the bottom of
   this table, AND add a dated row to the "Overview: Completed" table further down.

## Overview: Completed (sorted by date, newest first)

<!--
SORT RULES for this table — DO NOT BREAK when adding rows:
1. This is the full historical log, sorted by completion date (newest first).
   Do NOT re-sort by priority here — that is what the completed block at the
   bottom of the "Not Yet Implemented" table is for.
2. Each ID with a detail section links to its anchor, e.g. `[FEAT-18](#feat-18)`.
   Rows with "—" as ID are historical items that never had a FEAT-/SEC-/etc. number.
3. When adding a completed item, also:
   - Move its strikethrough row to the completed block of the "Not Yet Implemented" table.
   - Mark the detail section's status as complete (and keep the `<a id="...">` anchor).
-->

| ID | Feature | Completed | Category |
|----|---------|-----------|----------|
| — | **NW 7.50 FUGR/FUNC surface gaps** — `SAPWrite type=INCL` + `group=` gains create/delete of FUGR structural includes (CT `…functions.fincludes.v2+xml`; `L<GROUP>` naming enforced client-side; SAP maintains the main program's INCLUDE line). `SAPRead type=FUNC includeSignature=true` reports `processingType`/`updateTaskKind` back, so the attributes #634 writes can be verified. Adds release gates for DOMA create and `SAPManage create_package` (both endpoints absent < 7.52 — previously a raw 404 with a contradictory "not found, use SAPSearch" hint), and a `/repository/objectstructure` fallback so `SAPRead type=FUGR` works on 7.50. Live-verified end-to-end incl. `SAPActivate` on npl NW 7.50 SP02 + a4h 758. Evidence: [docs/research/2026-07-29-nw750-fixture-create-surface.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-29-nw750-fixture-create-surface.md) | 2026-07-29 | Features |
| — | **SDO source format fix + DSFD** — server-driven source PUT content type is now per-registry-entry (`sourceFormat: 'json' \| 'text'`), driving both the PUT `Content-Type` and the client-side `JSON.parse` gate. Fixes `SAPWrite update type=DTSC`, which SAP answered with a hard `415` on every system (and which the JSON gate rejected client-side before that). Adds `DSFD` (CDS Scalar Function Definition), live on 758 + 816. `batch_create` now refuses server-driven types instead of silently POSTing them to the PROG endpoint. Live-verified 758 + 816. | 2026-07-21 | Bugs/Features |
| — | DDIC structure context — `SAPContext(action="structure", type="TABL")` returns recursive TABL structure include trees plus append/extension structures confirmed from where-used candidates (`extend type <base> with`). Implementation: `src/adt/structure-hierarchy.ts` + `src/handlers/context.ts`; covered by parser/handler/schema tests and a BAPIRET2 integration smoke. A4H 2025 where-used 400 fallback returns the include tree with a warning instead of timing out. | 2026-06-26 | Features |
| — | 2026-06-24 deep-scan gap bundle — FEAT-63 pre-release inactive-objects check, FEAT-64 unknown-column hint, FEAT-41/FEAT-31 AUnit coverage, FEAT-65 TTYP read/create, FUGR structural-include write, CDS API-release write (`SAPManage set_api_state`), RAP behavior-extension create (`extend behavior for`), plus COMPAT-05 ToC advertise-text correction. Live-verified on 758 + 816 where applicable. | 2026-06-25 | Features/Compatibility |
| [FEAT-61](#feat-61) | Tool Extension Points (custom tools on top of ARC-1) — `ARC1_PLUGINS` local trusted plugin loader plus manifest-only plugins register `Custom_*` tools through the ToolRegistry, reusing the core safety / scope / audit pipeline; gated non-ADT writes via `ctx.http` (Path B). Phase 4 npm-package plugins intentionally deferred. Framework PR #454, policy hardening #467, `ctx.http` writes #474. | 2026-06-17 | Features |
| [FEAT-24](#feat-24) | CompareSource (Diff) — `SAPRead action="diff"` returns a server-side single-system unified diff between two source versions (active / inactive / revision id / ADT URI) with optional from/to display labels; completes the FEAT-49 → FEAT-20 → FEAT-24 transport-scoped code-review trio. PR #445, diff labels PR #528. | 2026-06-15 | Features |
| — | Server-driven object (SDO) **write** — `SAPWrite action=create\|update\|delete` + `SAPActivate` for `DESD\|EVTB\|DTSC\|CSNM\|EVTO\|COTA` via the same generic AFF engine (`src/adt/server-driven.ts`): create POSTs a `<blue:blueSource>` metadata body (per-type `createType`; blues `v1`, or **`v2` for EVTO**), source is written via lock→PUT `…/source/main`→unlock with the type's per-entry `sourceFormat` content type (AFF JSON for DESD/CSNM/EVTB/EVTO/COTA, DDL text for DTSC/DSFD — corrected 2026-07-21, see [the DTDC/DSFD probe dossier](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md)), then `SAPActivate` (generic activation endpoint). Discovery-gated (clean 8.16+ error otherwise), `allowWrites`-gated, `allowedPackages`-gated against the real package. Create leaves the object inactive. Per-type/release-adaptive gate (like the read path): live-verified on a4h-2025 (816) — all 6 types create, DESD full create→source→activate→read→delete round-trip; on a4h (758) **EVTB write also works** (cross-release) while the 816-only types return a clean "requires 8.16+" error; npl (7.50) gates all 6 cleanly (no crash).

| — | Server-driven object (SDO) read — `SAPRead type=DESD\|EVTB\|EVTO\|DTSC\|CSNM\|COTA` reads ABAP Platform 2025 (8.16) "server-driven" repository objects via one generic discovery-gated AFF engine (`src/adt/server-driven.ts`): metadata from `<blue:blueSource>` + AFF JSON source. Per-type/release-adaptive gate (EVTB also on S/4HANA 2023). 816 roadmap item #2 from the new-ADT-APIs research. Live-verified: a4h-2025 (816) reads DESD (CDS Logical External Schema) + EVTB (RAP Event Binding); a4h (758) reads EVTB, skips DESD. Write path shipped (see the SDO write row above). Plan: `docs/plans/completed/2026-06-05-add-server-driven-object-read.md`. | 2026-06-05 | Features |
| — | CDS test-case scaffolding — `SAPDiagnose action=cds_testcases` returns SAP-suggested ABAP Unit test cases for a CDS entity (CDS Test Double Framework): one suggestion per testable semantic (whole view / calculated field / CAST / JOIN) with a `testMethod` name, `description`, `semanticType`, optional `calculatedField`, plus a `cl_cds_test_environment` scaffolding `hint`. Read-only, discovery-gated to **SAP_BASIS 8.16+ (ABAP Platform 2025 / S/4HANA 2025)** — the first new-API capability mined from the 2025 ADT research. Live-verified: a4h-2025 (816) → 200, a4h (758) → clean skip. Plan: `docs/plans/completed/2026-06-05-add-cds-test-cases-scaffolding.md`. | 2026-06-05 | Features |
| [SEC-12](#sec-12) | XSUAA OAuth `state` Callback Proxy — fixes VS Code "State does not match" (XSUAA echoes literal `+`; signed base64url state token + `/oauth/callback` re-encodes). Removable only when XSUAA emits `%2B` (not vscode#314715). (PR #325) | 2026-06-01 | Security |
| [SEC-05](#sec-05) | Layered Rate Limiting — three independent per-instance layers: HTTP-edge per-IP buckets (`ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` / `ARC1_MCP_HTTP_RATE_LIMIT`), a per-user MCP token-bucket quota (`ARC1_RATE_LIMIT`), and one server-wide SAP-bound semaphore (`ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT`). Closes CodeQL `js/missing-rate-limiting` on `/authorize`. ADR-0004. (PR #276) | 2026-05-27 | Security |
| — | SAPSearch `tadir_lookup` `source` modes (`adt`/`db`/`both`) for TADIR ghost detection + SAPWrite `batch_create` `activateAtEnd` for interdependent / composition-linked objects. Both are opt-in fixes from the SEGW→RAP migration skill Run 6. Default behaviors unchanged: `source='adt'` keeps the existing ADT info-system path on read scope; `activateAtEnd=false` keeps per-object inline activation. The `db` and `both` sources issue `SELECT pgmid, object, obj_name, devclass FROM tadir WHERE obj_name IN (...)` via the existing freestyle-SQL path, surfacing orphan TADIR rows hidden by the ADT info-system; `both` adds a `splitBrain[]` array + per-name warnings explaining divergence (e.g. ghost from aborted create/delete cycle). `activateAtEnd=true` defers activation until the entire batch has been written, then issues one `activateBatch` — SAP's activator resolves cross-references between siblings in one pass (verified live: composition-linked DDLS pair activates cleanly via `activateAtEnd=true` vs the per-object path failing with `"data source ZR_CHILD does not exist or is not active"`). Plan: `docs/plans/completed/2026-05-11-add-batch-defer-activate-and-tadir-db-source.md`. | 2026-05-11 | Features |
| — | RAP handler skeleton CCIMP-only fix — `ensureRapHandlerSkeletons` was writing the `CLASS lhc_<alias> DEFINITION INHERITING FROM cl_abap_behavior_handler` block to CCDEF (`/source/definitions`), which the SAP activator rejects with `Local classes of "CL_ABAP_BEHAVIOR_HANDLER" can only be derived in the "Local Definitions/Implementations" of a global BEHAVIOR class`. Fix routes both DEFINITION + IMPLEMENTATION blocks into CCIMP per ABAP keyword doc `ABENABP_HANDLER_CLASS_GLOSRY` and SAP demo class `BP_DEMO_RAP_STRICT` (live-captured fixtures + integration regression test against the demo class). End-to-end verified on a4h S/4HANA 2023 (ABAP 7.58). **Breaking change** — pre-1.0; classes previously scaffolded by arc-1 carry the wrong CCDEF/CCIMP split and must be deleted + recreated to pick up the canonical layout. Plan: `docs/plans/completed/2026-05-11-fix-rap-handler-skeleton-include.md`. | 2026-05-11 | Fixes |
| — | PR-C `SAPWrite action=generate_behavior_implementation` — one-shot RAP behavior pool orchestrator. Auto-discovers the bound BDEF via class metadata's `<class:rootEntityRef>`, cross-validates `FOR BEHAVIOR OF` ↔ `managed implementation in class` agreement, scaffolds every required handler (creating missing `lhc_<alias>` skeletons), writes CCDEF + CCIMP under one stateful lock, and (by default) activates. Reliable equivalent of Eclipse ADT's "Generate Behavior Implementation" Cmd+1 quickfix without depending on the broken `/sap/bc/adt/quickfixes/proposals/.../create_class_implementation` server endpoint (HTTP 500 on a4h regardless of payload, verified live). Activation rejections matching the well-known stale-active CCDEF/CCIMP coupling return a guided recovery hint instead of throwing. Plan: `docs/plans/completed/2026-05-10-add-generate-behavior-implementation.md`. | 2026-05-10 | Features |
| — | Function-module structured-parameter management (issue [#252](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/252)). `SAPWrite(type='FUNC', parameters=[…])` accepts a structured array of `{kind: importing\|exporting\|changing\|tables\|exceptions\|raising, name, type, byValue?, default?, optional?}` and builds the ABAP source-based signature clause; `SAPRead(type='FUNC', includeSignature=true)` returns parsed JSON. New pure-function module `src/adt/fm-signature.ts` (build/parse/splice) with ~25 unit tests including round-trip property tests against real BAPI_USER_GETLIST + POPUP_TO_CONFIRM source bodies. Live probing on a4h S/4HANA 2023 + NPL 7.50 SP02 settled the long-standing fr0ster #77 "parameter loss" question — parameters live INLINE in `/source/main`, NOT in a separate metadata document. Side fix: removed FUNC from pre-write lint's lintable types (abaplint can't parse source-based FM signatures). | 2026-05-10 | Features |
| — | PR-E TADIR lookup + batch_create package fix — `SAPSearch(searchType="tadir_lookup")` adds exact cross-package object-directory lookup via ADT quick search, avoiding brittle long TADIR `IN (...)` SQL preflights. `SAPWrite(action="batch_create")` now honors item-level `package` and `transport` overrides, including TABL/BDEF `_package` query parameters and per-package safety/transport preflights. Plan: `docs/plans/completed/2026-05-10-pr-e-tadir-lookup-batch-create-package.md`. | 2026-05-10 | Features |
| — | CLAS include auto-init (issue #303 follow-up) — `SAPWrite(action="update", type="CLAS", include="testclasses", source=…)` auto-creates a missing class-local include (notably `testclasses`/CCAU on a fresh class) before writing: GET-probe → empty `POST …/includes/{inc}?lockHandle=` (201) under the class lock → content PUT. Closes the cryptic `500 "…CCAU does not have any inactive version"` gap. New `include-not-initialized` error category. Live-verified on a4h. | 2026-05-29 | Features |
| — | PR-A native CLAS include writes + RAP behavior handler auto-skeletons — `SAPWrite(action="update", type="CLAS", include="definitions"|"implementations"|"macros"|"testclasses")` writes local class includes via the parent class lock instead of corrupting `/source/main`; `scaffold_rap_handlers(autoApply=true)` now creates missing `lhc_*` CCDEF/CCIMP skeletons before injecting RAP handler signatures and empty implementation stubs. | 2026-05-10 | Features |
| — | Function-group (FUGR) and function-module (FUNC) write support — `SAPWrite create/update/delete` for both types with `group` parameter for FM (issue [#250](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/250)). FUGR routes through standard `objectBasePath`; FUNC bypasses with a dedicated URL pre-resolution branch in `handleSAPWrite` and `handleSAPActivate` (group from args; auto-resolved via search for update/delete). New `case 'FUGR'`/`case 'FUNC'` in `buildCreateXml`; `stripFmParamCommentBlock` helper auto-strips SAPGUI `*"…"*` parameter comment blocks (SAP rejects them with `FUNC_ADT028`). Verified live on a4h S/4HANA 2023 (full lifecycle); 132/132 E2E pass. Closes the "latent FUNC-update gap" flagged in 2026-04-27 competitor scan. | 2026-05-09 | Features |

## Prioritized Execution Order

> Priorities are assigned based on which [core design principle](#vision) a feature serves. Sourced from 4 competitor trackers ([fr0ster](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/fr0ster/overview.md), [VSP](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/overview.md), [abap-adt-api](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/overview.md), [dassian-adt](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/07-dassian-adt.md)) and the [cross-project feature matrix](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md).
>
> **2026-04-14 priority re-evaluation:** dassian-adt's explosive growth (0→32 stars, 25→53 tools, OAuth/XSUAA, multi-system in 2 weeks) and SAP's confirmed Q2 2026 GA for official ABAP MCP Server increase urgency on fix proposals (FEAT-12↑P1), error intelligence (FEAT-16↑P1), and pretty print (FEAT-10↑P1, completed 2026-04-17). SAP Joule entering the space makes ARC-1's enterprise-grade safety/auth differentiation even more important.
>
> **2026-04-16 additions:** Cross-project competitor analysis (VSP, fr0ster, dassian-adt deep dive) identified COMPAT-01..03 plus verify item COMPAT-04. Follow-up confirmed COMPAT-03 had already been fixed in PR #130 (commit `9b0601c`, completed 2026-04-15). COMPAT-01 and COMPAT-02 were fixed in this follow-up (completed 2026-04-16). FR0ster reached v6.1.0 (35 stars). VSP confirmed modificationSupport guard as root cause of recurring 423 lock errors and surfaced S/4HANA Public Cloud CSRF HEAD incompatibility (#104). PR #134 (SKTD) merged 2026-04-16 — ARC-1-unique Knowledge Transfer Document support now live. Enhancement (BAdI) ADT endpoints confirmed from fr0ster analysis. GetProgFullCode confirmed on-prem only via nodestructure API. Added **FEAT-49** at P1, originally scoped as object transport history; live endpoint research established that standard ADT exposes only the current lock plus assignment candidates, while complete history needs E071/E070 access. Enriched **FEAT-20** (revisions) with concrete ADT endpoint details and upgraded **FEAT-24** (diff) rationale. Overview table re-sorted by actual priority (P0→P1→P2→P3).
>
> **2026-04-23 additions:** Four merged items plus re-evaluation driven by open PR review and competitor scan:
> - **FEAT-55** — SM02 system messages + /IWFND/ERROR_LOG gateway errors wired into `SAPDiagnose` (PR #174). Matrix section 10 updated — ARC-1 no longer has any diagnostic feed that only fr0ster exposes.
> - **FEAT-56** — standalone ADT type-availability probe (`npm run probe`, multi-signal classifier, fixture-driven replay tests) merged (PR #163). FEAT-50 (fixture coverage contributions) remains open as the follow-up backlog item.
> - **FEAT-57** — `SAPContext(action="impact")` now catches asymmetric DDLS/DDLX metadata-extension coverage across sibling variants (PR #177) — the common RAP bug where one routing path has missing UI fields.
> - **FEAT-58** — DTEL v2→v1 Content-Type fallback + SICF-aware (`icf-handler-not-bound`) error classification (PR #169).
> - **SAPManage scope split** — read vs write sub-actions enforced via `SAPMANAGE_ACTION_SCOPES` in both standard and hyperfocused mode (PR #171). Read-only clients keep diagnostic manage actions.
> - **DOC-05** — three new skills merged (`sap-clean-core-atc`, `sap-unused-code`, `sap-object-documenter`) broadening the workflow layer beyond RAP (PR #164).
>
> PRs that were open at the time (not merged at 2026-04-23; later status noted where the current repo has since changed):
> - **PR [#179](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/179)** (samibouge) — **BUG-01 / P0**: SAPActivate reported "Successfully activated" for an inactive class on NW 7.50. Five independent parser/handler bugs combined into a silent no-op. Fix adds `<ioc:inactiveObjects>` detection in `parseActivationResult`, `/activation/inactive` → `/activation/inactiveobjects` fallback for `getInactiveObjects`, flat-shape support in `parseInactiveObjects`, new `version: 'active' \| 'inactive'` parameter on `SAPDiagnose action=syntax`, and NW 7.50 `<chkrun:checkMessage>` shape in `parseSyntaxCheckResult`. Also surfaces a wider **FEAT-60** gap (see below): CLI shortcut coverage lags MCP tool schemas across at least 9 tools.
> - **PR [#176](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/176)** — CDS CRUD dependency guidance for DDLS update/activate/delete (handler-level workflow hints, not a new ADT capability). Uses FEAT-51 number; the 2026-04-23 completions in this roadmap use FEAT-55..58 to avoid renumbering collision with the then-open PR. **Merged later**; current repo has the DDLS dependency guidance path.
> - **PR [#173](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/173)** — RAP on-prem authoring gap closure: deterministic RAP preflight for TABL/BDEF/DDLX/DDLS (`preflightBeforeWrite` toggle), new `SAPWrite action=scaffold_rap_handlers` with `dry-run`/`autoApply`, behavior-pool include scanning, per-object batch activation statuses. **Merged later**; current repo has `src/adt/rap-preflight.ts`, default-on `preflightBeforeWrite`, and the `scaffold_rap_handlers` path.
> - **PR [#161](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/161)** — BTP CF deployment diagram (`docs/btp-deployment.drawio`). Doc artifact only.
> - **PR [#151](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/151)** — SAPLint PrettyPrint + revision eval scenarios (test-only).
>
> Newly added roadmap items:
> - **BUG-01** (P0) — SAPActivate phantom success + CLI/server alignment (tracked by PR #179)
> - **FEAT-59** (P3) — Embeddable multi-tenant server with per-instance `systemType`. Competitive-tracking item inspired by fr0ster v6.4.0. ARC-1 is "one gateway per SAP system" today; a multi-tenant embedding story would matter for customers running many SAP systems behind one MCP gateway.
> - **FEAT-60** (P2) — CLI/server alignment. PR #179's matrix shows 9 of 12 MCP tools have no CLI shortcut, and the 3 that do expose fewer knobs than their Zod schemas accept. Auto-generating shortcuts from schemas would close the gap and prevent future drift.
>
> **2026-04-28 addition:**
> - **FEAT-62** (P2) — ADT Transaction (`TRAN/T`) source/write support. Research was triggered by [`jfilak/sapcli` PR #156](https://github.com/jfilak/sapcli/pull/156), which added `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/tran` transaction lifecycle support with JSON source and server-driven creation content. ARC-1 currently has metadata-only `SAPRead(type="TRAN")` through VIT. Live read-only probes found VIT metadata works on the configured 7.58 systems, but `/aps/iam/tran` returns 404 and is absent from discovery; the NPL 7.50 profile was reachable but auth-blocked. Track as feature-detected, on-prem-only source/write support. Full notes: [docs/research/2026-04-28-adt-transaction-source-write.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-04-28-adt-transaction-source-write.md).
>
> Priority re-eval (competitor-driven, 2026-04-23):
> - **FEAT-18** (Function Group Bulk Fetch) — still P1. The `npm run probe` (FEAT-56) and SQLite cache mitigate the round-trip cost; revisit if evals show LLMs hit 20+ FM groups repeatedly. Not downgrading yet — dassian's confirmed parallel fetch pattern means the gap is visible to users comparing tools.
> - **FEAT-24** (CompareSource/Diff) — **promote P2 → P1**. FEAT-20 supplies revision sources and FEAT-49 supplies current assignment context; target revision-to-revision client-side diff first. A transport-scoped diff still needs manifest normalization and honest snapshot-coverage labels.
> - **FEAT-34** (i18n Translation Management) — **hold at P2 but de-emphasize**. VSP added 7 translation tools in early April but has been quiet since 2026-04-15. Not blocking adoption signals for ARC-1; revisit if a specific customer ask lands.
> - **FEAT-07** (TLS/HTTPS) — stays P3. BTP CF + reverse proxy patterns are still the answer.
>
> Already-implemented sanity check (2026-04-23):
> - `SAPContext(action="impact")` already handles DDLS/DDLX upstream+downstream (FEAT-33, 2026-04-16) plus sibling DDLS/DDLX consistency (FEAT-57, 2026-04-22).
> - `SAPRead(type="VERSIONS" | "VERSION_SOURCE")` (FEAT-20, 2026-04-17) is live on on-prem; BTP exposure intentionally deferred.
> - `SAPTransport(action="history")` (FEAT-49, 2026-04-17) is live with a `transportchecks` fallback. The action name is legacy: output is current lock/assignment status, not complete history.
> - `SAPDiagnose` now covers dumps + traces + system_messages + gateway_errors + quickfix + apply_quickfix (FEAT-55, 2026-04-21). SQL trace (FEAT-09) is the only fr0ster-v5 diagnostic still missing.
> - `SAPGit` (FEAT-22, 2026-04-18) auto-selects gCTS→abapGit with a `--allow-git-writes` safety gate; VSP's gCTS lead is closed for the prioritized workflow set.
> - **OData/SQL performance insight** (2026-06-25): `SAPDiagnose action=odata_perf` (probe an OData URL with `?sap-statistics=true` → server-side gw* timing split + routing verdict) + `action=cds_sql` (CDS Show-SQL via `ddic/ddl/createstatements`) + an ICF-inactive activation guard (`icf-service-inactive`). Verified live on 7.50 / 758 / 816. Answers "why is this Fiori/OData request slow" without SAP GUI; SQL-trace control (FEAT-09 / ST05) is the next step.
> - **ST05 SQL-trace control** (2026-06-25, FEAT-09): `SAPDiagnose action=sql_trace_state`/`set_sql_trace_state` (read/arm/disarm the ST05 SQL trace via `/sap/bc/adt/st05/trace/state`) + `action=sql_trace_directory` (SAP returns the TMC "SQL Trace Analysis" deep-link to read records — there is no ADT SQL-record API). Verified live on 758. **Discovered the ADT-native ABAP Cross Trace API** (`/sap/bc/adt/crosstrace/*`, present on 758 not just 816; request types include OData V2/V4) — the strategic GUI-free record reader, scoped as a focused follow-up PR.
>
> Competitor scan (2026-04-23): only **fr0ster** has moved this week — v6.2.0 shipped per-object-type tool descriptions (13 types) and v6.4.0 added per-instance `systemType` on `EmbeddableMcpServer` (multi-tenant embedding capability ARC-1 lacks — tracked as FEAT-59). VSP, dassian-adt, mario, AWS Accelerator all quiet since before 2026-04-17.
>
> **2026-04-18 additions:** First-party workflow skills became an explicit productization layer. Research across SAP Help / ABAP docs, the `mcp-sap-docs` server, `sap-abap-base` steering docs, and `sap-skills` showed that common success patterns are workflow-level: system bootstrap, provider-contract selection, draft/auth defaults, impact-driven change analysis, revision/history inspection, formatter alignment, documentation capture, and Git/delivery context. ARC-1 now has enough primitives (`impact`, `VERSIONS`, `SAPTransport(action="history")`, `SAPLint` formatting/settings, `SKTD`, `SAPGit`) to encode those workflows directly in first-party RAP/common-use-case skills instead of just adding more raw endpoints.

4. ~~**FEAT-15** Namespace URL Encoding Audit (XS)~~ — **completed 2026-04-12** (audit confirmed `encodeURIComponent` consistency; XML attribute escaping hardened in `devtools.ts`)

### Phase A.5: Proactive Compatibility (P0)
6. ~~**FEAT-38** ADT Service Discovery / MIME Negotiation (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-14** (startup probe fetches `/sap/bc/adt/discovery`, request-time MIME selection uses cached map, 406/415 retry remains fallback)

### Phase A.6: Compatibility Bug Fixes (P0) — identified 2026-04-16
These bugs affect real-world deployments and were confirmed by cross-project competitor analysis:

- <a id="compat-01"></a>~~**COMPAT-01: modificationSupport guard in lockObject()** (XS)~~ — **completed 2026-04-16.** `lockObject()` now checks both `MODIFICATION_SUPPORT` and namespaced `modificationSupport` for explicit `false` and returns a targeted `AdtApiError` (423) before write attempts. Source: VSP commit 22517d4. [Eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/22517d4-lock-handle-bug-class.md)

- <a id="compat-02"></a>~~**COMPAT-02: CSRF HEAD→GET fallback (S/4HANA Public Cloud)** (XS)~~ — **completed 2026-04-16.** `fetchCsrfToken()` now retries with GET when HEAD returns 403, preserving existing 401/403 auth error behavior for true authorization failures. Source: VSP issue #104. [Eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/22517d4-lock-handle-bug-class.md)

- <a id="compat-03"></a>~~**COMPAT-03: V4 SRVB publish endpoint bug** (XS)~~ — **already completed 2026-04-15** in PR #130 (commit `9b0601c`) before this compatibility plan was executed. `publishServiceBinding()`/`unpublishServiceBinding()` now propagate the resolved binding type (`odatav2` or `odatav4`) correctly. [Eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/fr0ster/evaluations/51781d3-srvd-srvb-activate-variant.md)

- **BUG-01: SAPActivate phantom success + CLI/server alignment (NW 7.50)** (S) — **✅ completed 2026-04-26 via PR [#179](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/179)** (samibouge). Five independent bugs produced a silent no-op that reported success for an inactive class. See the [BUG-01 detail block](#bug-01).

- <a id="compat-04"></a>~~**COMPAT-04: BTP transport omission in safeUpdateSource()**~~ — **Likely NOT applicable to ARC-1.** fr0ster's bug was per-handler transport wiring (`UpdateInterface` missing what `UpdateClass` had). ARC-1's centralized `safeUpdateSource()` handles ALL types with `effectiveTransport = transport ?? (lock.corrNr || undefined)` — the pattern already correctly omits `corrNr` when undefined. **Verify** with BTP Cloud INTF update integration test. Source: fr0ster commit c2b8006 + issue #61. [Eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/fr0ster/evaluations/c2b8006-dump-simplify-updateintf-fix.md)

- <a id="compat-06"></a>**COMPAT-06: Outbound HTTP_PROXY / NO_PROXY support for SAP ADT traffic** (S) - ARC-1's ADT client should honor standard `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY` env vars for non-BTP outbound SAP calls. This is mainly for local, Docker, CI, and self-hosted enterprise networks where direct SAP egress is blocked by a corporate forward proxy. Keep BTP Destination Service / Cloud Connector precedence, prefer undici `EnvHttpProxyAgent` / `ProxyAgent` over hand-rolled env parsing, avoid `CONNECT` for plain `http://` SAP targets where undici supports `proxyTunnel: false`, and preserve 204/205/304 response handling. Research: [docs/research/http-forward-proxy-env-support.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/http-forward-proxy-env-support.md).

It is not complete history.
19. **DOC-01** Copilot Studio Setup Guide (S) — critical for enterprise adoption
20. **DOC-02** Basis Admin Security Guide (S) — admin audience needs clear guidance
21. ~~**DOC-04** RAP & Common ABAP Workflow Skill Pack Refresh (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-18.** Refreshed first-party RAP skills to use provider-contract guidance, `SAPContext(action="impact")`, revision/history reads, formatter settings, SKTD docs, and `SAPGit`; updated `skills/README.md` and `docs_page/skills.md` to document the new workflow layer.

### Phase C: ADT Feature Parity (P2) — Quick Wins
13. **FEAT-32** Table Pagination / Offset (XS) — VSP has this, practical improvement
14. ~~**FEAT-11** Inactive Objects List (XS)~~ — **completed** (via SAPRead type=INACTIVE_OBJECTS)
15. ~~**FEAT-19** Transport Contents (XS)~~ — **completed** (subsumed by FEAT-39)
16. **FEAT-21** ABAP Documentation / F1 Help (XS) — real docs instead of hallucination
17. **FEAT-28** SAP Compatibility Hardening (S) — 7 compat fixes bundled (expanded Apr 8)
18. **OPS-02** Health Check Enhancements (XS) — `/health/deep` with SAP connectivity check

### Phase D: ADT Feature Parity (P2) — Larger Items
20. ~~**FEAT-46** SRVB (Service Binding) Create (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-14** (SAPWrite now supports SRVB create/update/delete + batch_create; create guidance points to activate + publish flow).
21. ~~**FEAT-47** MSAG (Message Class) Read/Write (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-14** (SAPRead type=MSAG + SAPWrite/SAPManage MSAG create/update/delete)
22. ~~**FEAT-39** Transport Enhancements (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-13** (lifecycle operations; Workbench K create). sapcli has full CTS lifecycle.
21. ~~**FEAT-41** ABAP Unit Test Coverage (S)~~ — **completed 2026-06-25 (PR #503)**: `SAPDiagnose action="unittest"` with `coverage:true` returns statement/branch/procedure coverage, handles cross-release CLAS/OM variants, and degrades cleanly when the coverage endpoint is unavailable.
22. **FEAT-42** ATC Output Formats (XS) — JUnit4, checkstyle, codeclimate formatters for CI/CD integration. sapcli has these.
23. ~~**FEAT-43** DDIC Auth & Misc Read (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-17** (SAPRead types `AUTH`, `FEATURE_TOGGLE` (formerly `FTG2`, renamed in audit Plan B / PR #224), `ENHO`; Authorization Fields endpoint: `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/auth/{name}`, namespace `http://www.sap.com/iam/auth`)
24. ~~**FEAT-48** SKTD (Knowledge Transfer Documents) Read/Write (S)~~ — **✅ Completed 2026-04-16** (PR #134 merged). Unique to ARC-1. LLM-generated documentation for ABAP objects.
25. **FEAT-09** SQL Trace Monitoring (S) — completes diagnostics story (SM02 and /IWFND/ERROR_LOG already completed 2026-04-21 via FEAT-55 — SQL trace is the only fr0ster-v5 diagnostic still missing)
26. **SEC-05** Rate Limiting (S) — prevent runaway AI loops
26b. ~~**SEC-14** DNS-rebinding / Host-header validation (S)~~ — **implemented then DEFERRED 2026-06-25** (PR #500, closed-deferred). Mandatory HTTP auth is the primary rebind control; Host validation only matters in the no-auth mode a real deploy shouldn't use, so it's parked to avoid the `ARC1_ALLOWED_HOSTS` setup surface. Decision record + resume guide: [docs/plans/2026-06-25-sec-14-dns-rebinding-host-validation.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/2026-06-25-sec-14-dns-rebinding-host-validation.md).
26. ~~**FEAT-20** Source Version / Revision History (S) — promoted to P1/Phase B and completed 2026-04-17~~
27. ~~**FEAT-31** Code Coverage from Unit Tests (S)~~ — **resolved by FEAT-41 / PR #503**: `SAPDiagnose action="unittest"` with `coverage:true` returns coverage metrics.

25. **FEAT-24** CompareSource / Diff (S) — **↑ Upgraded:** with FEAT-20 (revisions) + FEAT-49 (object transport history), transport-scoped code review now viable (fr0ster#30). Client-side diff of two revision sources — ADT has no server-side diff endpoint.
26. **FEAT-26** MCP Client Config Snippets (S) — onboarding UX
27. **FEAT-25** CDS Unit Tests (S) — CDS test-driven development
28. **FEAT-23** GetProgFullCode / Include Traversal (S) — reduce round trips

36. **FEAT-30** ABAP Cleaner Integration (M) — optional Java-based code cleanup (see below)

### Phase E: New Capabilities from Competitor Sprint (P2-P3)
33. ~~**FEAT-31** Code Coverage from Unit Tests (S)~~ — **resolved by FEAT-41 / PR #503**: coverage is now available through `SAPDiagnose action="unittest"`.
34. **FEAT-32** Table Pagination / Offset (XS) — VSP added offset + columns_only to table contents
35. ~~**FEAT-33** CDS Impact Analysis (S)~~ — **completed 2026-04-16** (RAP-aware downstream consumer classification)
36. **FEAT-34** i18n Translation Management (M) — VSP added 7 translation tools

### Phase F: Future / Niche (P3)
37. **FEAT-07** TLS/HTTPS for HTTP Streamable (S) — most deployments use reverse proxy (BTP gorouter, nginx, K8s Ingress) for TLS termination; in-app TLS is edge case
38. **FEAT-05** Code Refactoring (L) — rename, extract method *(change package completed 2026-04-15)*
39. **FEAT-29** P3 Backlog — see [FEAT-29 table](#feat-29) for SSE, debugger, execute ABAP, call graph, UI5/BSP, RFC, embeddable server, lock registry, language attributes
40. **FEAT-50** ADT Probe Fixture Coverage — contributor-driven; widen fixture coverage for [`classifyVerdict`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/src/probe/runner.ts) across SAP product lines (BTP ABAP, S/4 Cloud, plain NW, ECC EhP7, …)
41. **FEAT-66** Interactive destructive-op confirmation on 2026-07-28 elicitation (S) — revisit with the SDK v2 migration; must be fail-closed and built on `inputRequired` (see [ADR-0006](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-mcp-legacy-era-until-triggers.md))

### Strategic Context: SAP Official ABAP MCP Server (Q2 2026)

SAP confirmed GA of ABAP Cloud Extension for VS Code with built-in agentic AI powered by official ABAP MCP Server in Q2 2026. Initial scope: RAP UI service development. Key implications for ARC-1:

1. **SAP's MCP server will be ABAP Cloud only** — ARC-1's on-premise + BTP support remains a differentiator
2. **SAP will re-offer Joule capabilities as MCP tools** — creates a baseline expectation for MCP tooling quality
3. **SAP is making local MCP servers available for SAP Build** — enables Cursor, Claude Code, Cline, Windsurf to use SAP frameworks
4. **ARC-1's safety system, multi-client support, and enterprise auth are not in SAP's scope** — the managed gateway model remains unique
5. **Risk**: SAP's official server may reduce demand for community alternatives for ABAP Cloud customers
6. **Opportunity**: ARC-1 serves the vast on-premise + RISE customer base that SAP's cloud-only offering won't reach
7. **Product implication**: raw tool parity is no longer enough; first-party workflow skills for RAP and common ABAP tasks are now a core adoption layer
8. **Execution consequence**: recent features (`impact`, revisions, transport history, formatter settings, SKTD, `SAPGit`) should be packaged into repeatable playbooks faster than competitors can accumulate more endpoints

## Details: Not Yet Implemented

<a id="feat-02"></a>
### FEAT-02: API Release Status Tool (Clean Core)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — critical for S/4HANA Cloud and clean core compliance |
| **Status** | Completed |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/7270ad7-api-release-state.md) |

**What:** Check whether an SAP object (class, function module, table, CDS view) is released, deprecated, or internal. Returns the API release state (C1 Released, C2 Deprecated, Not Released) and the recommended successor.

**Why:** Every S/4HANA Cloud / BTP ABAP customer needs to check if their code uses only released APIs. This is a "must have" for any AI copilot helping with ABAP Cloud development.

**Implementation (2026-04-10):** Added `API_STATE` type to `SAPRead`. Uses ADT endpoint `/sap/bc/adt/apireleases/{encoded-uri}` with `Accept: application/vnd.sap.adt.apirelease.v10+xml`. Returns structured JSON with contract-level states (C0-C4), successor info, and catalog metadata. Based on VSP's corrected implementation (commit 8a478aa).

**Follow-up — API-release WRITE: ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-25 (PR #506).** `SAPManage action=set_api_state` releases/revokes an object's C1 contract for ABAP Cloud / Clean Core. The PUT is a narrow **v10** GET→PUT transform (drops response-only nodes `atom:link`/`stateTransitions`/`transportObject`/`authValueObject`; keeps `status` + successor scaffold + `apiCatalogData/ApiCatalogs`; ≥1 visibility required, derived from the contract's behaviour defaults). Fail-closed package gate via the object's real package; idempotent no-op handling. Live-verified on 758 + 816. (Originally flagged 2026-06-24 as a dual-signal gap — both sapcli `874c3b3` `ddl apistate set` and vibing-steampunk set the release contract.)

<a id="feat-07"></a>
### FEAT-07: TLS/HTTPS for HTTP Streamable Transport
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 (downgraded from P0, 2026-04-11) |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Low — most deployments use reverse proxy for TLS termination |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [fr0ster tracker: TLS evaluation](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/fr0ster/evaluations/tls-https-support.md) |

**What:** Add native TLS support to the HTTP Streamable transport. fr0ster added this in v4.6.0 with `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` flags. Currently ARC-1 requires a reverse proxy (nginx, CF router) for HTTPS.

**Why:** Enterprise customers deploying outside BTP CF (e.g., on VMs, Kubernetes) need HTTPS without an external proxy. fr0ster's implementation shows the pattern: load cert/key files, create `https.Server` instead of `http.Server`.

**Why not:** Standard practice is reverse proxy (nginx, CF gorouter, K8s Ingress) for TLS termination — adding TLS inside the Node.js app duplicates certificate management. BTP CF already provides auto-renewed platform certs at the routing layer. In-app TLS adds complexity (hot-reload on cert renewal, potential for misconfigured cert chains) without improving security over a reverse proxy. For Docker-on-VM deployments the argument is stronger, but even there nginx+certbot is well-understood.

**Implementation:**
- Add `SAP_TLS_CERT` / `SAP_TLS_KEY` env vars (and `--tls-cert` / `--tls-key` CLI flags)
- In `src/server/http.ts`, conditionally create `https.createServer()` when cert/key are provided
- Auto-detect port 443 vs 8080 based on TLS mode

### FEAT-08: Content-Type 415/406 Auto-Retry
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — robustness fix for SAP system variations |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-12) |

> **Implementation note:** Already fully implemented in `src/adt/http.ts:325-398` with guard-protected single retry, fallback header logic, and 13 unit tests. Was implemented as part of the transport write compatibility work.
| **Source** | [fr0ster tracker: 415 evaluation](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/fr0ster/evaluations/415-content-type-retry.md), [VSP tracker: issue #9](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/issue-9-transport-accept-header.md) |

**What:** SAP systems vary in Accept/Content-Type expectations across versions and endpoint types. When a request gets 415 (Unsupported Media Type) or 406 (Not Acceptable), automatically retry with alternative Content-Type headers.

**Why:** Both fr0ster (issue #22/#23) and VSP (issue #9) hit this on transport endpoints. It's a common SAP ADT compatibility issue across system versions. A transparent retry in `src/adt/http.ts` would handle it for all endpoints.

**Why not:** ARC-1's `src/adt/http.ts` already has guard-protected retry logic for 406/415 with fallback headers. A code audit may reveal the existing implementation already covers the necessary cases. 415/406 errors are rare in practice — no production issues have been reported against ARC-1 specifically. Adding more elaborate retry strategies increases code surface for marginal gain.

**Implementation:**
- In `src/adt/http.ts`, intercept 415/406 responses
- Retry with `Accept: application/xml` -> `Accept: */*` (or vice versa)
- Retry with `Content-Type: application/xml` -> `text/plain` for transport endpoints
- Max 1 retry, log the fallback
- **See also FEAT-38** (ADT Service Discovery) for proactive MIME negotiation instead of reactive retry

<a id="feat-14"></a>
### FEAT-14: 401 Session Timeout Auto-Retry
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — prevents mid-conversation failures |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-12) |

> **Implementation note:** Added `authRetryInProgress` guard and 401 retry block to `src/adt/http.ts`. On 401: reset session (cookies + CSRF), re-apply auth (Basic or Bearer token refresh), re-fetch CSRF for modifying methods, retry once. Follows the same guard pattern as DB connection retry. 7 unit tests cover Basic Auth, Bearer token, guard, cookie clearing, and per-request guard reset.
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/d73460a-401-auto-retry.md) |

**What:** After idle, SAP returns 401. ARC-1 handles CSRF 403 refresh but may not handle 401 session timeout. Add silent re-authentication and retry on 401 in `src/adt/http.ts`.

**Why:** Mid-conversation failures are disruptive to LLM workflows. VSP (#32) and `abap-adt-api` both handle this. A centralized gateway that stays idle between user requests will hit this frequently.

**Why not:** Silent re-auth on 401 conflicts with ARC-1's stateless request design. In BTP ABAP (OAuth), a 401 means the token was rejected (revoked, clock skew, user deactivated) — retry won't help. In on-premise (Basic Auth), credentials are cached so 401 is a real auth failure. Silently retrying obscures the real failure and could break lock/modify/unlock transactions that depend on a consistent session. If ARC-1 re-authenticates, it needs stored credentials (security risk). Surfacing the error to the LLM lets it prompt the user to re-authenticate, which is more transparent.

### FEAT-15: Namespace URL Encoding Audit
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — prevents hard-to-debug failures |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-12) |

> **Implementation note:** Audit confirmed `encodeURIComponent()` is consistently applied across all 35+ call sites. Additionally hardened XML attribute escaping: extracted shared `escapeXmlAttr()` to `src/adt/xml-parser.ts`, applied it to all 6 interpolation sites in `devtools.ts`, and updated `codeintel.ts` and `transport.ts` to use the shared utility. 4 devtools escaping tests + 3 escapeXmlAttr unit tests added.
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/59b4b90-namespace-url-encoding.md), [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/6d1f00a-namespace-syntax-check.md) |

**What:** Namespaced objects (`/NAMESPACE/CLASS`) fail if `/` is not correctly encoded in ADT URLs. VSP hit this in issues #18, #52. Audit all `encodeURIComponent` usage in `src/adt/client.ts` and `src/adt/http.ts`.

**Why:** Namespaced SAP objects are common in enterprise systems. Silent URL encoding failures are hard to debug.

**Why not:** Code audit shows `encodeURIComponent` is consistently applied in all object name positions across `src/adt/client.ts`, `src/adt/crud.ts`, `src/adt/devtools.ts`, `src/adt/diagnostics.ts`, and `src/adt/codeintel.ts`. SAP object names are alphanumeric + underscore; the `/` in namespaced names (e.g., `/DMO/BS_BOOKING`) is already correctly encoded to `%2F` by `encodeURIComponent`. The "namespace" issue in VSP was XML namespace stripping, which ARC-1 handles differently via `fast-xml-parser` with `removeNSPrefix`. A formal audit is unlikely to find actionable bugs.

<a id="feat-12"></a>
### FEAT-12: Fix Proposals / Auto-Fix from ATC
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — safer than LLM-guessed fixes |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-04-14) |
| **Source** | [abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/issue-37-quickfix.md) |

**What:** When ATC or syntax check finds an issue, SAP's fix proposal API (`/sap/bc/adt/quickfixes`) suggests exact machine-applicable corrections. ARC-1 now exposes this via `SAPDiagnose` so the LLM can request proposals and apply deltas before writing.

**Why:** Safer than LLM-guessed fixes, preserves ARC-1 safety boundaries (proposal/apply-delta is read-only; write still goes through `SAPWrite` package/transport/read-only gates), and reduces trial-and-error token usage.

**Implementation (2026-04-14):**
- Added `getFixProposals()` and `applyFixProposal()` in `src/adt/devtools.ts` for `/sap/bc/adt/quickfixes/evaluation` and proposal-URI apply calls.
- Added new `SAPDiagnose` actions: `quickfix` and `apply_quickfix` (`src/handlers/schemas.ts`, `src/handlers/tools.ts`, `src/handlers/intent.ts`).
- Enriched ATC findings with quickfix metadata (`quickfixInfo`, `hasQuickfix`) in `parseAtcFindings()`.
- Added unit coverage in `tests/unit/adt/devtools.test.ts`, `tests/unit/handlers/intent.test.ts`, and schema/tool tests.
- Added E2E coverage block in `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts` for quickfix flow and ATC metadata verification.

| **Source** | [abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/646bb9b-dtel-doma-write.md) |

**What:** ARC-1 reads DOMA/DTEL but can't write properties or fixed values. The `abap-adt-api` library (v7.1.1) added `createDomainDefinition`, `createDataElement`, and `createStructure` with full property support. Add write support for these in SAPWrite.

**Why:** Blocks full AI-assisted data modeling workflows. A developer asking the LLM to "create a domain ZSTATUS with values A=Active, I=Inactive" currently can't be fulfilled end-to-end.

**Implementation (2026-04-12):**
- Added DDIC metadata XML builders in `src/adt/ddic-xml.ts` (`buildDomainXml`, `buildDataElementXml`) with fixed value support and strict DTEL field ordering.
- Added `updateObject` + `safeUpdateObject` in `src/adt/crud.ts` for lock/PUT/unlock metadata writes.
- Enabled `DOMA`/`DTEL` in SAPWrite schemas and tool definitions (`src/handlers/schemas.ts`, `src/handlers/tools.ts`), including DDIC-specific parameters.
- Wired SAPWrite create/update/batch_create in `src/handlers/intent.ts` to use DDIC v2 content types (`application/vnd.sap.adt.domains.v2+xml`, `application/vnd.sap.adt.dataelements.v2+xml`) and metadata write flow (no `/source/main`).
- Added unit tests, integration CRUD lifecycle tests, and E2E tests for DOMA/DTEL write paths.

### FEAT-16: Error Intelligence (Actionable Hints)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — directly improves admin control and LLM UX |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-15) |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern, Roadmap SEC-03 |

**What:** When SAP returns common errors (409 locked, 423 enqueued, 403 auth, 415 content type), return actionable hints: "Object locked by user X — check SM12", "Authorization failed — check SU53/PFCG", "Transport required — check SE09". Subsumes SEC-03 (S_DEVELOP awareness).

**Implementation (2026-04-15):**
- Added SAP-domain classification in `src/adt/errors.ts` (`extractExceptionType`, `extractLockOwner`, `classifySapDomainError`) using ADT XML exception `type id` + message patterns.
- Extended `formatErrorForLLM()` in `src/handlers/intent.ts` to prioritize domain hints for lock conflicts (409), enqueue/invalid lock handle (423), authorization failures (403), object-exists conflicts, activation dependency chains, and adjustment mode.
- Added transaction guidance: `SM12` (locks/enqueue), `SU53` (authorization), `SPAU` (adjustment mode); retained existing fallback hints for not-found, transport, DDIC save, and 5xx errors.
- Extended audit classification (`errorClass`) to include domain categories like `AdtApiError:lock-conflict`.
- Added unit tests for extraction/classification and intent hint routing plus E2E smoke assertions for validation/not-found hint behavior.

**Why:** Supports **centralized admin control** — admins and LLMs get clear guidance instead of raw SAP error HTML. Dassian does this well with its error intelligence pattern.

**Why not:** Error hints become stale across SAP releases — a hint for "error 409 = object locked" in 7.50 may not be accurate in BTP ABAP. ARC-1 only sees the HTTP status code, not the user's roles (SU01), package ownership (DEVC), or enqueue status (SM12), so hints are educated guesses rather than true intelligence. A generic "Check SU53" hint is what experienced developers already do — the feature adds noise without truly solving the diagnosis problem. It also increases the support burden: users follow the hint, get lost, and blame ARC-1.

### FEAT-17: Type Auto-Mappings for SAPWrite
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — reduces LLM confusion |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-14) |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern |

**What:** Auto-map friendly type codes to ADT internal codes: `CLAS` -> `CLAS/OC`, `INTF` -> `INTF/OI`, `PROG` -> `PROG/P`, etc. LLMs shouldn't need to know ADT's internal type code suffixes.

**Why:** Supports **token efficiency** — reduces failed create attempts where the LLM guesses the wrong type code.

**Why not:** The mapping is incomplete and fragile — SAP has multiple variants (`PROG/P` vs `PROG/I`, `CLAS/OC` vs class-include subtypes) and defaults may differ by release. (Note: `CLAS/LI` was previously listed here as an example but has been removed as invented per issue #218 audit / PR #223 — see `docs/plans/completed/2026-05-08-audit-purge-invented-adt-types.md`.) Power users who know the correct suffix can't bypass the auto-mapping, creating a false abstraction. Better error messages (extracting ADT's 400 "expected CLAS/OC" response) solve the root cause more cleanly. The mapping also encourages sloppy LLM behavior — if ARC-1 always "fixes" type codes, the LLM stops learning the correct ones, creating problems when users switch to other tools.

### FEAT-18: Function Group Bulk Fetch
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — significant token/round-trip savings |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern |

**What:** Fetch ALL includes and function modules of a function group in one call, instead of N sequential requests. Returns combined source with clear delimiters.

**Why:** Supports **token efficiency** — a function group with 20 FMs currently requires 20+ round trips. One bulk call reduces latency and simplifies the LLM's context.

**Why not:** ADT has no bulk fetch endpoint for function groups — implementation would still make N sequential HTTP calls internally, just hiding them from the client. The bottleneck is network latency, not round-trips — HTTP/2 pipelining and ARC-1's existing SQLite cache already mitigate this. Bundling 20+ function sources into one response may hit context window limits or timeout. Parsing "combined source with delimiters" is error-prone (function names with special characters, include ordering). The feature also conflicts with the per-object caching strategy in `src/cache/caching-layer.ts`.

### SEC-05: Layered Rate Limiting
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — fixes per-PP-user concurrency bug (100 users × `maxConcurrent` slots, not 10 total), prevents runaway AI loops, closes CodeQL alert `js/missing-rate-limiting` on `/authorize`. |
| **Status** | **Completed — 2026-05-12** ([PR #276](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/276)) |

**What shipped:** Three independent layers, per-instance and in-memory:

- **Layer 1 (HTTP edge)** — `express-rate-limit` uses separate per-IP buckets for OAuth (`/register`, `/authorize`, `/token`, `/revoke`) and MCP HTTP traffic (`/mcp` plus multi-target routes). `ARC1_AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` controls OAuth (default `20/min/IP`). MCP uses `ARC1_MCP_HTTP_RATE_LIMIT` when explicitly set; otherwise it derives `max(OAuth × 30, 600)/min/IP`. Setting the OAuth limit to `0` does not disable MCP protection; only an explicit MCP value of `0` does. On hit: HTTP `429` + `Retry-After` + RFC 9331 `RateLimit-*` headers + `auth_rate_limited` audit event.
- **Layer 2 (Per-user MCP quota)** — `rate-limiter-flexible` token bucket inside `handleToolCall`, keyed on `authInfo.userName ?? clientId ?? '__anon__'`. Configurable via `ARC1_RATE_LIMIT` (default `0`, disabled; multi-target deployments recommend starting at `120/min/user`). On hit: MCP tool error with structured `retryAfter` (NOT HTTP 429, so the agent loop backs off cleanly) + `mcp_rate_limited` audit event. Stdio mode exempt.
- **Layer 3 (SAP-bound semaphore)** — promoted the existing `Semaphore` from per-`AdtClient` to ONE server-wide instance constructed in `createAndStartServer` and threaded through every `buildAdtConfig` call. `ARC1_MAX_CONCURRENT` (default `10`) is now a true server-wide cap regardless of stdio/HTTP or shared/PP auth. Honors `Retry-After` on both `429` and `503` (clamped to 60 s, single retry, audit records `source: header|fallback`).

**Simplifications vs original SEC-05 proposal:** No `_BURST` env vars (the underlying limiters handle burst tolerance internally). No monitor mode for Layer 2 — it is an explicit operator opt-in. No Redis-backed shared state (preserves stateless-deployment property from PR #212; multi-instance attackers cost `N × limit` — acceptable). Cost weighting per tool is deferred to v2.

**Documentation:** Operator guide at [Rate Limiting Guide](rate-limiting.md). Design rationale: [ADR-0004](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/adr/0004-layered-rate-limiting.md).

**CodeQL alert linkage:** Alert #12 (`js/missing-rate-limiting`) on `/authorize` auto-closes on the next scan now that Layer 1 is mounted before the OAuth router.

### SEC-14: DNS-Rebinding / Host-Header Validation (HTTP/SSE)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (≤1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — defense-in-depth for self-hosted / localhost HTTP deployments; the MCP spec recommends it. On BTP CF the gorouter already fixes the `Host`, so the live exposure is the stdio→HTTP-bridge and bare-`localhost` cases. |
| **Status** | **Implemented, then DEFERRED (2026-06-25)** — built + hardened + live-verified on branch `feat/sec-14-dns-rebinding` (PR #500, closed-deferred); parked by product decision. Decision record + resume guide: [docs/plans/2026-06-25-sec-14-dns-rebinding-host-validation.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/2026-06-25-sec-14-dns-rebinding-host-validation.md). |
| **Source** | [fr0ster v7.2.0 `d1688c9`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/05-fr0ster-mcp-abap-adt.md); threat A4 in [docs/security-model.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/security-model.md) |

> **Deferred — why:** ARC-1's HTTP transport already *requires* MCP auth to start (`ARC1_API_KEYS` / OIDC / XSUAA, unless `allowHttpNoAuth` is explicitly set), which is the primary DNS-rebind control — a rebind attacker is rejected `401` before any tool call. Host validation is only load-bearing in the no-auth HTTP mode a real deploy should never use; everywhere else (stdio = no HTTP; BTP = gorouter + XSUAA; self-hosted = mandatory auth) it's redundant. The real cost is operator setup surface (`ARC1_ALLOWED_HOSTS`), so we keep it out to make deployment simpler. Resume by reopening PR #500 if a no-auth HTTP mode ever becomes a real deployment.

**What:** Validate the `Host` header on every HTTP/SSE request against an allowlist before the `/mcp` handler runs. A malicious web page can rebind its DNS to `127.0.0.1` and POST to a local MCP server from the victim's browser; `Origin`/CORS checks don't stop a same-origin-looking `Host`. fr0ster shipped a Host/Origin allowlist in v7.2.0; the MCP spec calls for the same.

**Why ARC-1 doesn't have it yet:** ARC-1 validates `Origin` (CORS, `ARC1_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, off by default) and OAuth redirect/issuer hosts, but never the `Host` header (`src/server/http.ts`). The bundled MCP SDK (1.29.0) *does* expose `enableDnsRebindingProtection`/`allowedHosts`/`allowedOrigins`, but marks all three **`@deprecated`** ("use external middleware for host validation instead" — verified in `webStandardStreamableHttp.d.ts:82-96`), so a hand-rolled Express middleware is the correct path, not the SDK flag (fr0ster v7.2.0 reached the same conclusion).

**Implementation sketch:** Middleware in `applySecurityMiddleware` (before `/mcp`) gated by `ARC1_ALLOWED_HOSTS`. Default empty = **auto-protect loopback binds only** (derive a `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`/`[::1]` allowlist from the bind addr) — the exact DNS-rebinding target; non-loopback binds (`0.0.0.0`, proxy/BTP where the gorouter controls `Host`) stay **off** unless configured; `*` disables. Add the env to `src/server/{config,types}.ts`, emit a `host_rejected` audit event (`level:'warn'`, mirroring `cors_rejected`), and register A4 as a controlled risk in `docs/security-model.md`. Full plan: [docs/plans/2026-06-25-sec-14-dns-rebinding-host-validation.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/2026-06-25-sec-14-dns-rebinding-host-validation.md).

### FEAT-63: Pre-Release Inactive-Objects Check (SAPTransport)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (≤1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — releasing a transport that still contains inactive objects fails SAP-side with a cryptic error; catching it client-side is a real CI/CD-promotion win. |
| **Status** | ✅ **Completed 2026-06-25 (PR #501)** — `inactiveObjectsForTransport` + block-before-release; live-verified 758 + 816 |
| **Source** | [dassian-adt `4cfd841`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/07-dassian-adt.md) |

**What:** Before `SAPTransport action=release` / `release_recursive`, cross-check the transport's object list against the inactive-objects list and warn (or block unless `force`) when there is overlap.

**Why it's cheap:** the primitive already exists — `client.getInactiveObjects()` + `InactiveListCache` (`src/cache/inactive-list-cache.ts`), surfaced today as `SAPRead type=INACTIVE_OBJECTS`. The release path (`src/handlers/transport.ts` `release`/`release_recursive` → `src/adt/transport.ts`) simply never consults it. Wire the check into the release handler and reuse the cached list.

### FEAT-64: Self-Correcting "Unknown Column" Hint (SAPQuery / Table Preview)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — turns a dead-end "unknown column" error into a one-shot self-correction, the same way ARC-1 already self-corrects unknown *table* names. |
| **Status** | ✅ **Completed 2026-06-25 (PR #502)** — `extractUnknownColumn`/`formatUnknownColumnHint` (T100 `ADT_DATAPREVIEW_MSG/004`); SAPQuery + TABLE_QUERY; live-verified 758 + 816 |
| **Source** | [dassian-adt `afc1b66`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/07-dassian-adt.md) |

**What:** When a table/SQL query references a column that doesn't exist, enrich the error with the table's valid column names so the agent retries without a human round-trip.

**Where:** ARC-1 already self-corrects unknown *tables* (`src/handlers/query.ts:180` suggests similar names via search) but not unknown columns. Add column enrichment in the `getTableContents`/`runTableQuery`/`runQuery` catch path (`src/adt/client.ts`) — fetch the table's component list (DD03L / structure read, already available) and append "valid columns: …". Best as a shared helper called from `query.ts`.

| **Status** | ✅ **Completed 2026-07-24** — the SDO engine was generalized off its `<blue:blueSource>`-only assumption: `SdoRegistryEntry` now carries per-type `metadataContentType`/`metadataRootQName`/`metadataNamespace`/`metadataRootLocalName`/`discoveryMarker` (blue family shares a `BLUE_METADATA` spread), so DTDC (`<dtdc:dtdcSource>`, `application/vnd.sap.adt.ddic.dtdc.v1+xml`, DDL-text source, `DTDC/DF`) is a plain registry entry. `SAPRead`/`SAPWrite create/update/delete`/`SAPActivate type=DTDC`; discovery-gated. Live-verified create→update→**activate**→read→delete on **758 and 816** (DESD regression-checked). `createstatements` (Show SQL) remains a separate follow-up.

### FEAT-68: ATC Check-Variant Listing
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium-high — `SAPDiagnose action=atc` takes a free-string `variant` today, so an LLM must guess a valid name or fall back to the system default. |
| **Status** | ✅ **Completed 2026-07-24** — `SAPDiagnose action=atc_variants` lists the check variants (`GET /atc/variants?name=<filter>`) + the system default (`GET /atc/customizing` → `systemCheckVariant`). The `variant` param doubles as the name filter. Read-only; live-verified 758 (184 variants) + 816 (215). Authoring CHKO/CHKC/CHKV objects remains out of scope (Basis governance, not LLM-driven). Dossier: [docs/research/2026-07-24-feat68-atc-variant-listing.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-24-feat68-atc-variant-listing.md). |

| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium-high for agent loops — check a whole package before activating, instead of one object per round-trip. |
| **Status** | Open. `syntaxCheck()` (`src/adt/devtools.ts`) already builds a list-shaped `<chkrun:checkObjectList>` but always emits exactly one `<chkrun:checkObject>`; `SAPDiagnose` takes scalar `name`+`type` with no `objects` array. `SAPActivate` already has a batch path to model it on. On SAP's ADT-for-Eclipse roadmap. |

### FEAT-70: Table Technical Settings
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | M |
| **Risk** | Medium |
| **Usefulness** | High — this is a completeness gap in a shipped feature, not a new one: TABL create currently produces tables with no delivery class, data class, size category, or buffering. |
| **Status** | Open. Zero hits for `deliveryClass` / `sizeCategory` / `bufferingType` / `dataMaintenance` in `src/`. Technical settings are only reachable as free text inside the DDL source ARC-1 passes through verbatim. On SAP's ADT-for-VS-Code roadmap for Q4/2026. |

### FEAT-73: Additional Drop-In Server-Driven Types (DRTY, DRAS, DSFI)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | S |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — each is a one-row `SDO_REGISTRY` addition once the budget allows, and DRTY/DRAS are the same DDL-text flavor the 2026-07-21 `sourceFormat` fix made expressible. |
| **Status** | Open, **blocked on the tool-schema budget** (`WRITE_WIRE_WALL` is a hard ceiling at 68 000 bytes; the surface sits at 67 986). Contracts read live: DRTY `define type …` (DDL text, blues v1, 758 + 816), DRAS `@EndUserText.label … define …` (DDL text, blues v1, instance seen on 816), DSFI (AFF JSON, blues v2, `blue:blueSource` on 816; the 758 metadata GET returned `exc:exception` and needs a per-release check). `createType` is NOT derivable (EVTB=`EVTB/EVB`, DSFD=`DSFD/SCF`) — each type needs its own live `$TMP` create probe. Evidence: [docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md) |

### FEAT-71: Dictionary Activation Log
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |

| **Usefulness** | Medium-high — activation failures are a top LLM failure mode, and ARC-1 activates constantly; a readable log would improve error feedback. |
| **Status** | Open, **needs research first**. `/sap/bc/adt/activation/runs` is `405` POST-only on both systems, so there is no simple GET log reader — the earlier "cheap win" assessment was wrong. On SAP's ADT-for-VS-Code roadmap for Q4/2026. Live-probed 2026-07-21 on a4h 2023 (758) + a4h-2025 (816) — see [docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md). |

| **Usefulness** | Low-medium — on SAP's ADT-for-VS-Code roadmap for Q4/2026 (BTP + S/4HANA Cloud only). |
| **Status** | Open. Both collections advertise **`application/vnd.sap.adt.blues.v1+xml`** on 758 and 816 (the earlier `406` was a wrong `Accept`, not an unsupported endpoint), so they look like plain `SDO_REGISTRY` rows. Blocker: **no DTIX instance exists on either test system**, so neither the metadata root nor the source flavor nor the `createType` can be confirmed — needs seed data before it can be built. Live-probed 2026-07-21 on a4h 2023 (758) + a4h-2025 (816) — see [docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-21-sap-vscode-roadmap-dtdc-dsfd-probe.md). |

### FEAT-65: TTYP (Table Type) Read/Write
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — table types are common DDIC objects; ARC-1 has no read or write support at all. Both dassian-adt (`5f691ff`) and sapcli ship create. |
| **Status** | ✅ **Completed 2026-06-25 (PR #504)** — read + create (built-in & structure rows; POST shell → follow-up PUT sets the real row type); discovery-gated off NW 7.50; live-verified 758 + 816 |
| **Source** | [dassian-adt `5f691ff`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/07-dassian-adt.md) |

**What:** Read + create/update DDIC Table Types (TTYP). Add `TTYP` rows to both `*_TYPE_TABLE`s in `src/handlers/tool-registry.ts`, a create-XML builder in `src/adt/ddic-xml.ts` (DOMA/DTEL are the templates), and URL routing in `src/handlers/object-types.ts`.

### FEAT-03: Enhancement Framework (BAdI/Enhancement Spot)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — important for customization scenarios |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | fr0ster (confirmed ADT endpoints via deep analysis 2026-04-16) |

**What:** Read enhancement spots, BAdI definitions, and enhancement implementations. Confirmed ADT endpoints (from fr0ster deep analysis):

- **Enhancement source code** (on-prem only): `GET /sap/bc/adt/programs/programs/{name}/source/main/enhancements/elements` — returns base64-encoded enhancement source; auto-detects object type (class/program/include); supports `include_nested=true` to traverse all includes
- **Enhancement spot (BAdI spot) metadata**: `GET /sap/bc/adt/enhancements/enhsxsb/{spot_name}` — returns spot metadata including `badi_definitions` array (name, shorttext, interface)
- **Enhancement implementation**: retrieve specific BAdI implementation by name + spot

Note: The `/enhancements/elements` endpoint is **on-prem only** (SAP BTP ABAP Cloud does not expose this endpoint).

**Why:** BAdIs are the primary extensibility mechanism in SAP — LLMs helping with customization need to discover and understand them. fr0ster (v6.1.0, 35 stars) and sapcli both have this. Having confirmed ADT endpoints removes the implementation uncertainty.

**Why not:** BAdI discovery is primarily a human-driven IDE task (Eclipse ADT, SE80) — LLMs almost never implement BAdIs autonomously. Reading BAdI definitions overlaps with what `SAPRead CLAS` already provides (method signatures of the implementing class). Adding enhancement-specific tools violates the "12 intent-based" design philosophy. The on-prem-only restriction means BTP users can't use this feature.

### FEAT-06: Cloud Readiness Assessment
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — unique differentiator for S/4HANA migration |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Run ATC checks with ABAP Cloud check variant to assess whether code is cloud-ready. Combined with the enhanced abaplint integration (system-aware cloud/on-prem presets, pre-write validation, auto-fix), provide a comprehensive clean core compliance report.

**Why:** AWS ABAP Accelerator has this as a key feature. ARC-1 combines ATC cloud checks with `@abaplint/core` for offline linting.

**Why not:** `SAPLint` (abaplint with cloud preset) + `SAPDiagnose` (ATC checks) already cover cloud readiness individually — a combined report just concatenates outputs the LLM can already interpret. Enterprise cloud readiness assessments are formal compliance projects with custom rules; a generic tool won't satisfy their requirements. Combining two independently tested tools risks version mismatch errors (old ATC + new abaplint = false positives).

**Current state (partially implemented):**
- System-aware abaplint presets (BTP cloud vs on-prem) with auto-detection from SAP_BASIS release
- Pre-write lint validation blocks cloud_types/strict_sql/obsolete_statement violations on BTP
- Auto-fix via `lint_and_fix` action (keyword_case, obsolete_statement, etc.)

### FEAT-09: SQL Trace Monitoring
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — performance diagnostics |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [Feature matrix #17](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Read SQL trace state, list SQL traces, analyze trace results. Uses ADT endpoints `/sap/bc/adt/runtime/traces/sql/*`. VSP has `GetSQLTraceState`, `ListSQLTraces`.

**Why:** Completes the diagnostics story alongside short dumps and profiler traces. Useful for AI-assisted performance analysis.

**Why not:** SQL tracing is a performance debugging tool, not a development task — LLMs don't optimize query performance, humans do. ADT's trace endpoints are read-only (can't start/stop traces from ADT — users must start them in SAP's ST05), making the tool half-featured. A single SQL trace can contain thousands of lines, bloating the LLM context window for marginal diagnostic value.

### FEAT-10: PrettyPrint (Code Formatting)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — code formatting via ADT API |
| **Status** | Done |
| **Source** | [Feature matrix #14](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Format ABAP source code via ADT's PrettyPrint API. VSP and mcp-abap-abap-adt-api have this. Also includes get/set PrettyPrinter settings.

**Why:** Consistent code formatting is important for readability and team standards.

**Resolution:** Implemented as three `SAPLint` actions: `format` (server-side ADT PrettyPrint), `get_formatter_settings`, and `set_formatter_settings`. Formatter settings are read/written via `/sap/bc/adt/abapsource/prettyprinter/settings`, while source formatting uses `/sap/bc/adt/abapsource/prettyprinter`. See implementation plan and checklist in [docs/plans/completed/2026-04-17-prettyprint-adt-formatter.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/completed/2026-04-17-prettyprint-adt-formatter.md).

### FEAT-11: Inactive Objects List
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — development workflow improvement |
| **Status** | Done (via SAPRead type=INACTIVE_OBJECTS) |
| **Source** | [Feature matrix #19](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** List inactive objects system-wide. VSP and fr0ster both have this. Uses `/sap/bc/adt/activation/inactive`.

**Why:** Helps developers find objects they forgot to activate or that need attention.

**Why not:** System-wide queries can be slow on large systems (100K+ custom objects), blocking the MCP session. This is an administrative/housekeeping concern, not a development task — SAP's REPO_LIFECYCLE_MGR transaction is the canonical tool. LLMs don't decide "activate this old object" — humans do. The feature would sit mostly unused in typical LLM workflows.

### FEAT-19: Transport Contents (E071 List)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — show objects inside a transport request |
| **Status** | ✅ Completed (subsumed by FEAT-39) |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern, abap-adt-api |

**What:** List the objects (E071 entries) contained in a transport request. Both dassian and abap-adt-api support this. Useful for reviewing what an LLM has changed before release.

**Resolution:** Subsumed by FEAT-39. Transport object parsing (`tm:abap_object` elements) is now included in `getTransport()` responses when the SAP system returns them. Objects are parsed best-effort from task nodes with fields: pgmid, type, name, wbtype, description, locked, position.

### FEAT-20: Source Version / Revision History
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 ↑ |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — version comparison, rollback context, transport-scoped code review |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-17) |
| **Source** | [abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/d3c6940-source-versions.md), [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/dd06202-version-history.md), [fr0ster#30](https://github.com/fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/issues/30) |
| **Related** | FEAT-49 (current object transport status), FEAT-24 (diff) |

**What:** List revision history of ABAP objects and retrieve source at a specific revision. Combined with an explicitly selected transport manifest and FEAT-24 (diff), this supports transport review where SAP exposes an unambiguous released snapshot or pending draft. FEAT-49 contributes current lock/assignment context but does not identify complete historical membership.

**Completed notes (2026-04-17):**
- Added on-prem SAPRead types: `VERSIONS` (revision feed as JSON) and `VERSION_SOURCE` (raw source by opaque revision URI).
- `VERSION_SOURCE` now validates ADT-local paths (`/sap/bc/adt/...`) before request dispatch.
- BTP exposure intentionally deferred: `VERSIONS`/`VERSION_SOURCE` are currently on-prem only until endpoint parity is verified on BTP ABAP Environment.

**ADT endpoints (confirmed via abap-adt-api + VSP):**

1. **List revisions:** The version URL is discovered dynamically from the object's structure metadata — a link with `rel="http://www.sap.com/adt/relations/versions"`. The concrete URL patterns:

   | Object Type | Version History Endpoint |
   |---|---|
   | PROG | `GET /sap/bc/adt/programs/programs/{name}/source/main/versions` |
   | CLAS | `GET /sap/bc/adt/oo/classes/{name}/includes/{include}/versions` |
   | INTF | `GET /sap/bc/adt/oo/interfaces/{name}/source/main/versions` |
   | FUNC | `GET /sap/bc/adt/functions/groups/{parent}/fmodules/{name}/source/main/versions` |
   | INCL | `GET /sap/bc/adt/programs/includes/{name}/source/main/versions` |
   | DDLS | `GET /sap/bc/adt/ddic/ddl/sources/{name}/source/main/versions` |
   | BDEF | `GET /sap/bc/adt/bo/behaviordefinitions/{name}/source/main/versions` |
   | SRVD | `GET /sap/bc/adt/ddic/srvd/sources/{name}/source/main/versions` |

   - **Accept:** `application/atom+xml;type=feed`
   - **Response:** Atom XML feed where each `<entry>` contains: `uri` (version source URL), `version` (transport number from `atom:link`), `versionTitle`, `date`, `author`

2. **Retrieve source at version:** Two approaches:
   - `GET {version_uri}` — the `uri` field from the revision feed entry, with `Accept: text/plain`
   - `GET {sourceUrl}?version=active|inactive|{versionId}` — query parameter on the standard source URL

**Implementation (delivered):**
- `src/adt/client.ts`: added `getRevisions(type, name, opts)` + `getRevisionSource(versionUri)` with read safety checks.
- `src/adt/xml-parser.ts`: added Atom feed parser `parseRevisionFeed`.
- `src/handlers/intent.ts`: added `SAPRead` routing for `VERSIONS` and `VERSION_SOURCE` with friendly 404 handling.
- `src/handlers/schemas.ts`/`src/handlers/tools.ts`: on-prem schema/tool enums extended; BTP intentionally unchanged.
- Tests: new unit fixtures and parser/client/handler tests, integration coverage, and e2e coverage (`tests/e2e/revisions.e2e.test.ts`).

**Why:** Version history is essential for code review and understanding change context. Together with a selected manifest and FEAT-24, it enables snapshot-aware transport review without pretending an open request always has an exact pre-change revision. Three competitors already have revision reads (dassian-adt `abap_revisions`, VSP 3 version tools, abap-adt-api `sourceVersions`/`loadSourceVersion`).

**Why not:** ADT's version management endpoints may not exist in all SAP releases (notably older ECC systems). Modern ABAP shops use abapGit or gCTS for version control, making SAP's internal versioning redundant. LLMs rarely need historical source ("show me the version from 2 weeks ago") — they work with current source. However, the transport-scoped review use case (fr0ster#30) is compelling and well-defined.

**Competitive update (2026-04-08):** VSP added 3 version history tools (commit dd06202, Apr 2): list versions, compare versions, get specific version. Both VSP and abap-adt-api now have this. dassian-adt has `abap_revisions` (list only, no version-specific source retrieval).

### FEAT-21: ABAP Documentation (F1 Help)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — LLM fetches real docs instead of hallucinating |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/7d5c653-abap-documentation.md), VSP |

**What:** Fetch official ABAP keyword documentation (F1 help) via ADT API. The `abap-adt-api` library (v7.1.0) added `abapDocumentation`. Lets the LLM look up correct syntax instead of guessing.

**Why:** LLMs sometimes hallucinate ABAP syntax. Real documentation prevents this.

**Why not:** LLMs already know ABAP keywords well from training data — fetching F1 docs adds latency for redundant information. ADT doesn't have a clean endpoint for keyword documentation; would need to parse SAP's help server or documentation XML (version-specific, fragile). SAP's F1 docs vary by release, so a "fetch keyword doc" tool returns inconsistent results across systems. Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini have cleaner ABAP knowledge than SAP's own F1 text.

### FEAT-22: gCTS/abapGit Integration
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — Git-based ABAP workflows |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-04-18) |
| **Source** | Dassian, [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/81cce41-gcts-tools.md), abap-adt-api |

**What was delivered:**
- New `SAPGit` intent tool with backend auto-selection (prefers gCTS, falls back to abapGit).
- New backend clients: `src/adt/gcts.ts` (JSON `/sap/bc/cts_abapvcs/*`) and `src/adt/abapgit.ts` (XML/HATEOAS `/sap/bc/adt/abapgit/*`).
- New safety gate `--allow-git-writes` / `SAP_ALLOW_GIT_WRITES` (default `false`) for all git write operations.
- Feature probing extended with gCTS detection; tool registration is feature-gated.
- End-to-end coverage added (unit + integration + e2e for SAPGit read paths and safety behavior).

**Backend coverage:**
- **Both:** `list_repos`, `clone`, `pull`, `switch_branch`, `create_branch`, `unlink`
- **gCTS-only:** `whoami`, `config`, `branches`, `history`, `objects`, `commit`
- **abapGit-only:** `external_info`, `check`, `stage`, `push`

**Result:** FEAT-22 is closed; ARC-1 now has parity on gCTS/abapGit workflows with leading competitors while preserving ARC-1's safety model.

**Competitive update:** VSP's gCTS lead is closed for the prioritized workflow set via `SAPGit`.

### FEAT-23: GetProgFullCode (Include Traversal)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — reduces round trips for programs with includes |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | fr0ster (confirmed ADT endpoints via deep analysis 2026-04-16) |
| **Restriction** | **On-prem only** — SAP BTP ABAP Cloud does not expose the `nodestructure` API needed for include discovery |

**What:** Fetch a program with all its includes resolved into a single response. Confirmed ADT endpoints (from fr0ster deep analysis):

1. **List includes via nodestructure API** (on-prem only): `GET /sap/bc/adt/repository/nodestructure?objecttype=PROG/P&objectname={name}&node_id=000000` — finds `PROG/I` nodes, fetches their children to discover all includes
2. **Read include source**: `GET /sap/bc/adt/programs/includes/{includeName}/source/main`
3. **Recursive traversal**: Parse `INCLUDE <name>.` and `INCLUDE: <name1>, <name2>.` statements recursively from each include

For FUGR (function groups), the same pattern applies with `objecttype=FUGR/P` and source via `/sap/bc/adt/programs/includes/{include}/source/main`.

**Why:** Simplifies reading programs with many includes — reduces N+1 round trips. fr0ster has `GetProgFullCode`. Useful for LLMs working with large legacy programs that heavily use includes (a very common pattern in ECC/on-prem codebases).

**Why not:** `SAPContext` with dependency extraction already resolves includes and returns combined context with AST-based compression (7-30x reduction). A dedicated "full code" tool just renames existing functionality without adding behavior — it violates the 12-tool design principle. The LLM can already request `SAPRead PROG` followed by individual includes if needed. **On-prem only** (SAP BTP doesn't expose nodestructure for includes), so BTP users get no benefit. The recursive traversal is fragile — malformed INCLUDE statements or circular dependencies cause infinite loops.

### FEAT-24: CompareSource (Diff)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 ↑ |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — token-efficient revision and pending-draft comparison |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-06-15, PR #445) |
| **Source** | VSP, [fr0ster#30](https://github.com/fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/issues/30) |
| **Depends on** | FEAT-20 (revision history — provides version URIs to diff against) |
| **Related** | FEAT-49 (current lock/assignment context; not complete history) |

**What:** Diff two versions of one ABAP source object: active vs inactive, revision vs active, or two explicit revisions. A transport review composes this primitive with `SAPTransport get` for a selected request and `VERSIONS` for snapshot selection. Open transports often have no pre-request snapshot, so active→inactive covers only pending source and must not be presented as every change already activated in that request.

**ADT API finding:** ADT has **no server-side diff endpoint**. All competitors (VSP, abap-adt-api) compute diffs client-side by fetching both version sources and generating a unified diff. VSP's `CompareVersions()` fetches `GetRevisionSource(version1_uri)` and `GetRevisionSource(version2_uri)` (or current source), then generates unified diff text with added/removed line counts.

**Implementation (delivered):**
- `SAPRead(action="diff", type, name, from, to)` accepts `active`, `inactive`, revision ids, or full ADT revision URIs.
- `src/adt/version-diff.ts` resolves both sources; `src/adt/source-diff.ts` generates unified hunks and added/removed counts with normalized line endings.
- The operation is read-only and returns only the patch instead of two full sources.
- Transport-level CTS-entry normalization, structured aggregation, and output bounds remain a separate follow-up.

**Why:** Computing the unified diff in ARC-1 saves significant tokens and makes pending/revision review practical. Exact transport-scoped review additionally requires a selected manifest, CTS-entry normalization, and an unambiguous snapshot pair; FEAT-49 alone cannot supply historical membership.

**Why not:** LLMs are excellent at diffing code — the user can fetch two sources via `SAPRead` and ask the LLM to compare them. A diff utility is a client concern, not a server concern. However, having the MCP server compute the diff saves significant tokens (sending only changed lines vs. two full source files) and reduces round-trip complexity from 3 tool calls to 1.

**Competitive update (2026-04-16):** VSP has `CompareVersions` (client-side diff of revision sources). fr0ster#30 requests this as `GetDiff`. ARC-1 now has the single-object primitive; a first-class transport-level aggregator remains follow-up work.

### FEAT-25: CDS Unit Tests
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — CDS test-driven development |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | fr0ster |

**What:** Create, run, and check CDS unit tests. fr0ster is the only project with this capability. Enables AI-assisted CDS development with test coverage.

**Why:** CDS views are increasingly central to S/4HANA development. Test support enables test-driven CDS development.

**Why not:** CDS unit tests (via CDS Test Environment) require ABAP code generation for test doubles and fixture setup — ADT doesn't have a dedicated endpoint. The complexity is 3-4x higher than ABAP unit tests. LLMs can already generate CDS unit test code directly, create the test class via `SAPWrite batch_create`, and run it via `SAPDiagnose` — no intermediate tool needed. The feature is a convenience wrapper over existing capabilities, not new functionality.

### FEAT-26: MCP Client Config Snippets
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — great onboarding UX |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [fr0ster eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/fr0ster/evaluations/5f975fe-mcp-client-configurator.md) |

**What:** `arc-1 config --client claude` prints ready-to-paste MCP client configuration. fr0ster supports 11 clients. Lowers the barrier to first connection.

**Why:** Reduces friction for first-time setup.

**Why not:** Config snippets are static reference material that belongs in documentation, not in a CLI command. ARC-1 is an MCP server, not a configuration guide generator. Setup guides already cover client configuration. Maintaining config templates for 11+ MCP clients adds a maintenance burden that scales with the ecosystem — every new client version may change its config format.

### FEAT-27: Migration Analysis (ECC->S/4)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — custom code migration check |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | AWS ABAP Accelerator |

**What:** Run custom code migration checks to identify ECC code that needs changes for S/4HANA. AWS ABAP Accelerator has this as a key feature. Complements FEAT-06 (Cloud Readiness Assessment).

**Why:** S/4HANA migration is a major SAP customer initiative.

**Why not:** S/4HANA readiness is a subset of cloud readiness checks — `SAPLint` with the cloud preset already handles most migration warnings (deprecated statements, classic ABAP, etc.). SAP's Code Inspector (SCI) and ATC have dedicated S/4HANA migration checks that enterprises use formally in their migration projects. Organizations doing ECC->S/4 migrations won't rely on an LLM-driven tool for compliance — they use SAP's official readiness check tools with formal sign-off processes.

### FEAT-28: SAP Compatibility Hardening
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days total) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — prevents edge-case failures across SAP versions |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | Multiple competitor trackers |

**What:** A bundle of small compatibility fixes identified across all competitor trackers:
1. **ATC ciCheckFlavour workaround** — older SAP systems don't support the `ciCheckFlavour` parameter (dassian pattern)
2. **Stateful session header** — some ADT endpoints require `X-sap-adt-sessiontype: stateful` ([abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/issue-30-stateful-mode.md))
3. **Include lock parent resolution** — includes inherit parent's lock; verify FUGR/PROG includes lock correctly ([abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/issue-36-include-lock.md))
4. **Ignore syntax warnings on save** — syntax warnings should not block saves ([VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/7fbfbba-ignore-warnings.md))
5. **Transport endpoint S/4 compat** — transport creation endpoint differs on S/4HANA 757+ ([VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/ca02f47-transport-endpoint-compat.md))
6. **Auth headers on redirect** — SAP may redirect, and auth headers get stripped on cross-origin redirects. Verify undici/fetch behavior. ([VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/27d4d7c-auth-redirect-stateful.md), added 2026-04-08)
7. **Lock handle 423 errors** — recurring issue in VSP (#91, #88, #78). Verify ARC-1 crud.ts handles 423 gracefully. ([VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/issue-91-lock-handle-423.md), added 2026-04-08)

**Why:** Prevents real-world failures across SAP versions.

**Why not:** "7 compat fixes" is a bundle without clear scope — each item needs individual evaluation. Some items may already be handled (ARC-1 uses `withStatefulSession()` for lock sequences, undici handles cookies). Bundle approach suggests one-off patches rather than systematic compatibility handling. Version-specific workarounds add technical debt and conditional logic that's hard to test (requires access to each SAP version).

### FEAT-30: ABAP Cleaner Integration (Future)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — adds Java 21 dependency, ~200MB Docker image increase |
| **Usefulness** | High for teams already using ABAP cleaner profiles |
| **Status** | Research complete, not started |

**What:** Optional integration with SAP's [ABAP cleaner](https://github.com/SAP/abap-cleaner) CLI (`abap-cleanerc`) for 100+ code cleanup rules with 469 configuration options. Runs as a pre-stage before abaplint in the lint/fix pipeline. Teams can mount their `.cfj` profile files to enforce company coding standards.

**Why:** Many SAP teams already maintain ABAP cleaner profiles (`.cfj` files) as their shared coding standard. Integrating this means LLM-generated code automatically conforms to the team's existing rules — no new rule configuration needed. ABAP cleaner handles transformations abaplint can't: READ TABLE -> table expressions, string concatenation -> string templates, FINAL declarations, advanced alignment (21 DDL/CDS-specific rules).

**Why not:** Adding a 200MB Java 21 runtime to a Node.js npm package increases distribution size dramatically. Docker image bloats from ~150MB to ~350MB. JVM boot time (1-2s) adds latency to every lint operation. `@abaplint/core` already covers most formatting and cleanup rules locally without external dependencies. Maintaining a polyglot pipeline (Java + Node.js) doubles the operational complexity. If ABAP Cleaner breaks on a Java update, ARC-1 is responsible for the debugging.

**Architecture:** Three-stage pipeline: ABAP cleaner (Java CLI, transforms) -> abaplint (TypeScript, lint+fix) -> pre-write gate (TypeScript, block/pass). ABAP cleaner is optional — if Java/JAR not found, skipped silently. CLI invoked via `child_process.execFile` with `--source` for inline processing (<128KB) or temp files for larger sources. Output captured from stdout.

**Key details from research:**
- CLI: `abap-cleaner --source "<ABAP>" --release "757" --profile "team.cfj"` -> cleaned source on stdout
- No stdin support — must use `--source` flag or `--sourcefile` with temp file
- No reliable exit codes (always 0) — error detection via stderr content
- Profile format: `.cfj` (JSON-like key-value with version header), `--profiledata` accepts inline content
- Release flag (`--release "757"`) maps to our existing `cachedFeatures.abapRelease`
- Docker: requires Java 21 + Eclipse RCP app (~200MB total). Suggest two image variants: `latest` (lean) and `with-cleaner` (full)
- Reference implementation: `vscode_abap_remote_fs/abapCleanerService.ts` wraps CLI with temp files + 30s timeout

**Config options (planned):**
- `SAP_ABAP_CLEANER_PATH` / `--abap-cleaner-path` — path to CLI binary
- `SAP_ABAP_CLEANER_PROFILE` / `--abap-cleaner-profile` — path to `.cfj` profile
- `SAP_ABAP_CLEANER_ENABLED` / `--abap-cleaner-enabled` — `auto` (default), `true`, `false`

### FEAT-31: Code Coverage from Unit Tests

| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — test quality assessment |
| **Status** | ✅ **Resolved by FEAT-41 (2026-06-25, PR #503)** — `SAPDiagnose action=unittest` supports `coverage:true` |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/333f462-code-coverage.md) |

**What:** Return code coverage metrics from ABAP Unit test runs. VSP added `GetCodeCoverage` (commit 333f462, Apr 4). ARC-1 now returns statement/branch/procedure coverage through `SAPDiagnose action=unittest` with `coverage:true`.

**Why:** Coverage metrics help assess test quality and identify untested code paths.

**Resolution:** FEAT-41 implemented the ADT runtime-trace coverage measurement flow. ARC-1 summarizes aggregate coverage and `methodsBelowFull` instead of returning raw line-level output, which keeps the response usable for LLM-driven test work.

### FEAT-32: Table Pagination / Offset
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — practical query improvement |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/9fb6c8a-table-pagination.md) |

**What:** Add `offset` parameter for cursor-style pagination and `columns_only` for schema-only queries to SAPQuery table preview. VSP added these (commit 9fb6c8a, Apr 4), closing their issue #34. ARC-1 has `maxRows` but no offset.

**Why:** Pagination enables browsing larger tables and exploring data.

**Why not:** MCP is stateless per call — paginated queries require maintaining cursor state or session affinity that ARC-1 doesn't provide. LLMs fetch data once with a reasonable `maxRows` limit; "fetch rows 101-150" is an interactive UI pattern, not an LLM workflow. `$top=50` is usually sufficient for the LLM to understand the data shape. Adding offset introduces complexity for a rare use case.

### FEAT-33: CDS Impact Analysis
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — increasingly important as S/4 moves logic into CDS |
| **Status** | Done (2026-04-16) |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/6c67140-cds-impact.md) |

**What:** CDS-specific impact analysis is now available via `SAPContext(action="impact", type="DDLS", name="...")`. It returns upstream CDS AST dependencies and downstream RAP-classified where-used consumers in one response.

**Why:** CDS views are the foundation of S/4HANA — understanding downstream impact is critical before making changes.

**Scope:** Scoped intentionally to the RAP stack immediately around a CDS view (projection chain, BDEF, SRVD, SRVB, DCLS, DDLX, direct ABAP consumers). Multi-level transitive tracing remains out of scope for a single call — follow-up analysis can be done via `SAPNavigate(action="references")` on individual consumers when needed.

### FEAT-34: i18n Translation Management
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — multilingual ABAP development |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/566f1f7-i18n-tools.md) |

**What:** Translation management tools: text elements, OTR texts, message class management, translation status, per-request language override. VSP added 7 translation tools (commit 566f1f7, Apr 5), closing their issue #40. ARC-1 has T100 message read and text elements read but not full management.

**Why:** Multilingual support is required for most enterprise SAP implementations.

**Why not:** i18n management is a niche domain requiring specialized SAP knowledge that LLMs don't have (translation workflows, OTR maintenance, text consistency checks). Text elements, OTR, and message classes are managed in different places with no unified ADT endpoint — building a tool requires hacking across fragmented APIs. Translation is usually managed by dedicated translators or compliance teams, not developers or LLMs. The feature adds tool complexity for a workflow that's better served by SAP's native SE63 transaction.

### FEAT-36: Type Information (SAPNavigate)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — endpoint availability varies by SAP version |
| **Usefulness** | Medium-High — variable type resolution for LLM |
| **Status** | Deferred — endpoint not available on test system |
| **Source** | [ADT API Audit](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/complete/2026-04-09-adt-api-audit-documentation-and-unused.md) |

**What:** `POST /sap/bc/adt/abapsource/typeinformation` returns the complete type of a variable/expression at a given source position. Tested on A4H 7.52 — returned 404. May be available on newer SAP NetWeaver/S/4HANA versions. Revisit when a newer test system is available.

**Why:** Type resolution helps LLMs understand variable usage without guessing.

**Why not:** LLMs can infer types from source context by tracing declarations, assignments, and method signatures — they don't need a SAP round-trip for this. The ADT endpoint returned 404 on the test system, suggesting limited availability. Even where available, the endpoint requires exact source position (line, column), which LLMs don't naturally produce. Type inference is what IDEs do with hover — LLMs are as good at this from reading source code.

### OPS-02: Health Check Enhancements
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — better monitoring |
| **Status** | Basic `/health` exists |

**What:** Enhanced health endpoint that checks SAP connectivity, returns version info, uptime, feature availability. Separate `/health` (load balancer, always fast) from `/health/deep` (includes SAP connectivity check).

**Why:** Better monitoring for production deployments.

**Why not:** Deep health checks (attempt to read TADIR, run syntax check) can hang if SAP is under load or the network is slow, making the monitoring tool itself unreliable. Kubernetes/Docker already have liveness/readiness probes that ARC-1 should use. If a deep health check fails, the behavior is unclear (reject all requests? partially? alert operator?) — simple connectivity checks ("can we reach SAP?") are sufficient and reliable.

### DOC-01: End-to-End Copilot Studio Setup Guide
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — critical for adoption |
| **Status** | Partially done (oauth-jwt-setup.md updated with Copilot Studio section) |

**What:** Complete guide with screenshots covering:
1. Entra ID app registration (step-by-step)
2. BTP CF deployment (manifest, `cf push`, env vars)
3. Power Automate custom connector creation (Security tab configuration)
4. Copilot Studio agent creation with ARC-1 as MCP server
5. Common errors and fixes (troubleshooting table with all AADSTS errors)

**Why:** Critical for enterprise adoption. The primary use case (Copilot Studio) needs a clear guide.

**Why not:** Minimal. Documentation should always be done. The only risk is screenshots becoming outdated as Copilot Studio evolves, requiring periodic maintenance.

<a id="doc-02"></a>
### DOC-02: Basis Admin Security Guide
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — SAP Basis admins need clear guidance |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Dedicated guide for SAP Basis administrators covering:
- What ARC-1 does and doesn't do (it's a proxy, not an ABAP runtime)
- SAP-side authorization: S_DEVELOP, ICF service activation for ADT
- Safety controls: read-only mode, allowed packages, operation filters
- How to create a restricted technical user for ARC-1 (minimal S_DEVELOP authorization)
- How to set up STRUST/CERTRULE for principal propagation
- Monitoring: where to check SAP security audit log (SM20) for ARC-1 activity
- How ARC-1's safety layer complements SAP's native authorization

**Why:** SAP Basis admins are the gatekeepers for enterprise adoption. They need clear, familiar guidance.

**Why not:** Minimal. Documentation targets a critical audience. The only consideration is that the guide must be reviewed by an actual Basis admin to ensure accuracy.

<a id="doc-03"></a>
### DOC-03: SAP Community Blog Post
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — visibility and adoption |
| **Status** | Planned; no report is currently committed |

**What:** Publish on SAP Community: "ARC-1: Connecting SAP ABAP to Microsoft Copilot Studio via MCP" covering architecture, security model, and setup.

**Why:** SAP Community visibility drives adoption.

**Why not:** Marketing, not a feature. Better timing is after P1 + most P2 features are stable — ship the product first, then evangelize. One blog post in a sea of SAP Community content may not move the needle for adoption.

### DOC-04: RAP & Common ABAP Workflow Skill Pack Refresh
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — converts raw RAP/tool capability into repeatable workflows |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-18) |

**What:** Refresh first-party skill markdown for RAP service generation, RAP logic implementation, and common ABAP bootstrap flow so the workflow explicitly uses the newest ARC-1 features and up-to-date SAP guidance. This includes:
- Provider-contract aware service exposure defaults (`odata_v4_ui` vs `odata_v4_webapi`)
- Draft/auth guidance aligned with current RAP docs (`#MANDATORY` + DCL, total ETag, draft constraints)
- `SAPContext(action="impact")` and revision/history reads before edits
- `SAPLint` formatter settings + optional formatting step before writeback
- `SKTD` read/write for attached knowledge-transfer docs
- `SAPGit` context for repo-managed packages
- Stronger `mcp-sap-docs` usage patterns for RAP research prompts

**Why:** SAP's own MCP direction starts with RAP UI service generation. ARC-1 already has the tool primitives; the missing layer was codified workflow guidance that turns those primitives into consistent outcomes for common use cases.

**Outcome (2026-04-18):** Updated `skills/generate-rap-service-researched.md`, `skills/generate-rap-service.md`, `skills/generate-rap-logic.md`, `skills/README.md`, and `docs_page/skills.md`. Research also incorporated ideas from `sap-abap-base` steering docs and `sap-skills`: treat workflow/steering quality as a first-class differentiator instead of chasing tool-count inflation.

### DOC-05: First-Party Skill Pack Expansion
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — turns ARC-1 primitives into repeatable clean-core and documentation workflows |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-19, PR #164) |

**What:** Added first-party skills for clean-core ATC review, unused-code detection, and object documentation capture.

**Why:** These workflows use ARC-1's existing diagnostics, context, transport, linting, and documentation tools to solve repeatable ABAP maintenance tasks without adding more raw MCP endpoints.

<a id="feat-37"></a>
### FEAT-37: DCL (Access Control) Read/Write
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — completes RAP development workflow |
| **Status** | ✅ Completed (2026-04-15) |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md) |

**What:** Added full read/write support for CDS access control objects (`DCLS`) via ADT ACM endpoints.

**Implemented (2026-04-15):**
- Added `getDcl(name)` to `src/adt/client.ts` using `/sap/bc/adt/acm/dcl/sources/{name}/source/main`.
- Added `DCLS` routing in `src/handlers/intent.ts`:
  - `handleSAPRead()` read path
  - `objectBasePath()` to `/sap/bc/adt/acm/dcl/sources/`
  - `buildCreateXml()` with `dcl:dclSource` and `DCLS/DL`
  - Type alias mapping `DCLS/DL -> DCLS`
  - DDIC save-hint and post-save syntax-check sets
- Added `DCLS` to SAPRead/SAPWrite type enums for on-prem + BTP in `src/handlers/schemas.ts` and `src/handlers/tools.ts`.
- Added unit coverage (client + handler + XML/type mapping tests) and E2E RAP lifecycle coverage for DCLS create/activate/read/delete.

<a id="feat-38"></a>
### FEAT-38: ADT Service Discovery (MIME Negotiation)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — eliminates 415/406 content-type errors proactively |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-14) |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md), sapcli `sap/adt/discovery.py` |

**What:** Call `GET /sap/bc/adt/discovery` at startup to learn which MIME type versions each ADT endpoint supports. Cache the accepted Content-Type/Accept values per endpoint. Use correct headers from the start instead of guessing and retrying on 415/406.

**Why:** sapcli has done this since 2018 — it's the standard ADT pattern. ARC-1 currently uses reactive retry logic (FEAT-08) which adds latency and doesn't cover all edge cases. The discovery document tells you exactly what each endpoint accepts, eliminating guesswork.

**Why this is better than FEAT-08 alone:** FEAT-08 retries after failure (1 extra round-trip per mismatch). FEAT-38 probes once at startup and gets it right the first time for all subsequent requests. Combined approach: discovery at startup + FEAT-08 retry as fallback.

**Implementation (2026-04-14):**
- Added `src/adt/discovery.ts` with `fetchDiscoveryDocument()`, `resolveAcceptType()`, and `resolveContentType()`
- Added `parseDiscoveryDocument()` to `src/adt/xml-parser.ts` and discovery fixture/tests
- `probeFeatures()` now fetches `/sap/bc/adt/discovery` in parallel and stores `discoveryMap` on `ResolvedFeatures`
- `AdtHttpClient` now uses startup-cached discovery map for proactive `Accept`/`Content-Type` defaults
- 406/415 retry logic now caches successful negotiated headers per endpoint as a learning fallback
- Startup wiring injects cached discovery into all request clients (shared and per-user PP)

### FEAT-39: Transport Enhancements
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — completes CTS lifecycle for LLM workflows |
| **Status** | ✅ Completed |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md) |

**What:** Extend SAPTransport with delete transport/task, reassign owner, recursive release, and transport contents parsing. `CreateCorrectionRequest` creates Workbench (K) requests; other request kinds need separate endpoints and remain deferred. Subsumes FEAT-19.

**Implemented:**
- `deleteTransport()` with recursive flag (deletes unreleased tasks first)
- `reassignTransport()` with recursive flag (reassigns unreleased tasks first)
- `createTransport()` creates Workbench (K) requests; package/layer inputs influence route and target, not request kind
- `releaseTransportRecursive()` as new action (releases tasks before parent)
- Transport object parsing (`tm:abap_object`) in GET responses
- Fixed Accept header bugs in `getTransport()` and `releaseTransport()`
- All new operations gated by `checkTransport()` safety checks

**Deferred:** Transport types S (Development-Correction) and R (Repair) require specific CTS configuration that most systems lack.

### FEAT-40: FLP Launchpad Management (OData)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — OData API, different from ADT REST |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — enterprise Fiori rollout automation |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-12) |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md), sapcli `sap/cli/flp.py` + `sap/odata/` |

**What:** Manage Fiori Launchpad configuration: catalogs, groups, target mappings, and tile assignments. Uses OData service `/sap/opu/odata/UI2/PAGE_BUILDER_CUST` (on-prem) or equivalent BTP API.

**Why:** Fiori Launchpad configuration is a major pain point in SAP projects. Automating catalog/group/tile setup via LLM saves hours of manual work per role. This is the kind of high-value enterprise automation that differentiates ARC-1 from developer-only tools.

**Implementation:**
- `src/adt/flp.ts` — OData client for PAGE_BUILDER_CUST with double-JSON tile config handling
- SAPManage actions: `flp_list_catalogs`, `flp_list_groups`, `flp_list_tiles`, `flp_create_catalog`, `flp_create_group`, `flp_create_tile`, `flp_add_tile_to_group`, `flp_delete_catalog`
- Feature-gated via `featureFlp` config (auto-probed at startup)
- Write ops use `OperationType.Workflow` — blocked unless `SAP_ALLOW_WRITES=true`
- Tiles read via `Pages('<pageId>')/PageChipInstances` — a `$filter` on `pageId` short-dumps the backend

<a id="feat-41"></a>
### FEAT-41: ABAP Unit Test Coverage (Statement-Level)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — enables test-driven ABAP development |
| **Status** | ✅ **Completed 2026-06-25 (PR #503)** — `SAPDiagnose unittest coverage:true` → statement/branch/procedure %; 2-step ADT flow; live-verified 758 + 816 |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md), sapcli `sap/adt/aunit.py` |

**What:** Fetch statement, branch, and procedure coverage after running ABAP Unit tests. ARC-1 discovers the coverage measurement URI from the ABAP Unit response, then uses the ADT coverage measurement endpoint with paginated follow-up for large result sets.

**Why:** Coverage data tells the LLM which methods and lines are untested, enabling targeted test generation. sapcli and AWS Accelerator both have this; ARC-1 now returns coverage metrics when requested instead of only pass/fail test results.

**Concern:** Coverage for a large class can be noisy. ARC-1 returns summarized aggregate percentages plus a worst-first `methodsBelowFull` list rather than raw line-by-line output.

**Implementation:**
- `SAPDiagnose action=unittest` accepts `coverage:true`
- `runUnitTests({ coverage: true })` in `src/adt/devtools.ts` performs the two-step run -> coverage measurement flow
- Parser returns aggregate statement/branch/procedure coverage plus `methodsBelowFull`, with `coverageNote` fallback when coverage is unavailable
- Handler/tool/schema tests plus live 758/816 verification are covered by PR #503

### FEAT-42: ATC Output Formats
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — CI/CD integration |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md) |

**What:** Format ATC check results as JUnit4 XML, checkstyle XML, or codeclimate JSON. Currently ARC-1 returns raw ATC results.

**Why:** Standard output formats enable integration with CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI) and code quality dashboards.

**Implementation:**
- Add `format` parameter to ATC handler in `src/handlers/intent.ts` (`raw`, `junit4`, `checkstyle`, `codeclimate`)
- Formatter functions in new `src/adt/atc-formatters.ts`
- Default to current format for LLM consumption; optional structured formats for CI/CD

<a id="feat-43"></a>
### FEAT-43: DDIC Auth & Misc Read (Authorization Fields, Feature Toggles, Enhancement Implementations)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — niche but useful for authorization analysis |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-17) |
| **Source** | [sapcli comparison](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/09-sapcli.md), sapcli commit `2ec4228` (Apr 2026) |

**What:** Add read support for Authorization Fields (`/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/auth/{name}`, XML namespace `http://www.sap.com/iam/auth`), Feature Toggles (`/sap/bc/adt/sfw/featuretoggles/{name}/states`), and Enhancement Implementations (`/sap/bc/adt/enhancements/enhoxhb/{name}`). sapcli recently added Authorization Fields (Apr 2026) and has had Feature Toggles since 2023.

**Why:** Authorization analysis is important for security audits. Feature toggles are used in SAP's switch framework for conditional features.

**Implementation:**
- Add `getAuthorizationField(name)` to `src/adt/client.ts`
- Add `getFeatureToggle(name)` to `src/adt/client.ts`
- Add both types to SAPRead handler
- XML parsing in `src/adt/xml-parser.ts` for the `auth:auth` namespace

<a id="feat-44"></a>
### FEAT-44: TABL (Database Table) Create
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — blocks RAP stack creation from scratch |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-14) |
| **Source** | [RAP project analysis](https://github.com/Xexer/abap_rap_blog), [SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap), [feature matrix](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Add create/update/delete support for traditional DDIC database tables (TABL) via SAPWrite. Tables are a prerequisite for CDS-based RAP development — root views reference persistent tables, and draft tables are required for managed BOs with draft.

**Current gap:** Closed in 2026-04-14 implementation.

**Competitor support:**
- **sapcli:** Full TABL CRUD via `POST /sap/bc/adt/ddic/tables/` + batch activation. XML serialization with `OrderedClassMembers` preserves element order.
- **vibing-steampunk:** CreateTable tool in Focused mode with batch activation.
- **fr0ster:** `HandlerCreate` routes to tables URL; auto-activates post-create (v5.0.7+).
- **dassian-adt:** `abap_create` with 16 type auto-mappings including TABL.

**Implementation:**
- Add `'TABL'` to `SAPWRITE_TYPES_ONPREM` and `SAPWRITE_TYPES_BTP` in `src/handlers/tools.ts`
- Add `'TABL'` to SAPWrite schema enums in `src/handlers/schemas.ts` (single + batch object schemas)
- Add TABL case to `buildCreateXml()` in `src/handlers/intent.ts` using `blue:blueSource` and `adtcore:type="TABL/DT"` (same shell pattern as BDEF)
- Keep TABL source-based (not DDIC metadata type): create shell with POST, then write source via `/source/main` using existing `safeUpdateSource` flow
- Keep content-type as `application/*` for create (same behavior as DDLS/SRVD)
- TABL requires activation after create (already supported via `SAPActivate`)
- Add unit tests for TABL create/update/delete/batch_create routing and create-XML output
- Add E2E lifecycle test (`tests/e2e/rap-write.e2e.test.ts`) for TABL create/read/activate/update/delete

### FEAT-45: DEVC (Package) Create
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |

| **Source** | [RAP project analysis](https://github.com/Xexer/abap_rap_blog), [SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap), [feature matrix](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Add package creation via SAPManage. Packages are the container for all ABAP development objects.

**Implemented (2026-04-14):** SAPManage actions `create_package` and `delete_package` with ADT endpoint `/sap/bc/adt/packages`.

**Competitor support:**
- **sapcli:** `POST /sap/bc/adt/packages` with full XML body (name, description, superPackage, softwareComponent, transportLayer). Accepts explicit `corrNr` for transport.
- **vibing-steampunk:** CreatePackage tool in Focused mode. Note: package safety bypass bug #101 (SAP_ALLOWED_PACKAGES not enforced on create) — ARC-1 should avoid this.
- **fr0ster:** Generic `HandlerCreate` routes to packages URL.
- **dassian-adt:** `abap_create` with auto-derived software component + transport layer.

**Implementation:**
- Added `buildPackageXml()` (`pak:package` root, `DEVC/K`) in `src/adt/ddic-xml.ts`
- Added SAPManage actions: `create_package`, `delete_package`
- Added transport pre-flight guidance for non-local parent packages
- Enforced package allowlist on the parent package (`superPackage`)
- Implemented delete via lock/delete/unlock flow
- Updated schemas/tool definitions, tests, and docs/feature matrix

### FEAT-46: SRVB (Service Binding) Create
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — completes RAP stack lifecycle (ARC-1 already has publish/unpublish) |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-04-14) |
| **Source** | [RAP project analysis](https://github.com/Xexer/abap_rap_blog), [SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap), [feature matrix](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Add SRVB object creation to SAPWrite. ARC-1 already reads SRVB and can publish/unpublish via SAPActivate.

**Implemented (2026-04-14):**
- Added `SRVB` to SAPWrite type enums and input schemas (on-prem + BTP).
- Added SRVB XML builder (`srvb:serviceBinding`) with `serviceDefinition`, `bindingType`, `category`, `version`.
- Added `buildCreateXml()` SRVB case and metadata-write routing (XML PUT update path, no `/source/main`).
- Added vendor content type for SRVB updates: `application/vnd.sap.adt.businessservices.servicebinding.v2+xml`.
- Added SAPWrite create response hint to run activation then `publish_srvb`.
- Added unit + E2E coverage for create/update/delete/batch_create and publish lifecycle.

**Competitor support (reference):**
- **sapcli:** Full SRVB CRUD via `POST /sap/bc/adt/businessservices/bindings/` with vendor-specific content type.
- **fr0ster:** `HandlerCreate` supports SRVB creation (v5.0.0+).
- **vibing-steampunk:** No create, only publish/unpublish.
- **dassian-adt:** No SRVB create.

**Note:** SRVB and DCL are now covered end-to-end. TABL (FEAT-44), DEVC (FEAT-45), MSAG (FEAT-47), and DCL (FEAT-37) are completed.

### FEAT-47: MSAG (Message Class) Read/Write
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — used in RAP exception classes and validation messages |
| **Status** | Completed |
| **Source** | [SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-abap-rap), [feature matrix](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Add read and write support for ABAP message classes (MSAG / T100). ARC-1 can already read T100 messages via `SAPRead type=MSAG` (message class listing), but cannot create message classes or add/update individual messages.

**Current gap:** Message classes are used in RAP for structured error messages in exception classes (`zdmo_cx_rap_generator` → `zdmo_cm_rap_gen_msg`). Without MSAG write, LLMs must use hardcoded text in RAISEs instead of proper message classes.

**Competitor support:**
- **sapcli:** Full message class CRUD. Read via `/sap/bc/adt/messageclass/{name}`, individual messages via `/sap/bc/adt/messageclass/{name}/messages/{number}`.
- **vibing-steampunk:** Message class read (T100 listing).
- **fr0ster:** Message class read via `adt-clients` factory.
- **dassian-adt:** No message class support.

**Implementation:**
- Add `MSAG` to `objectBasePath()` → `/sap/bc/adt/messageclass/`
- Add `MSAG` to `SAPWRITE_TYPES_ONPREM` and `SAPWRITE_TYPES_BTP`
- MSAG is a DDIC metadata type (XML-only, no source code)
- XML body includes message class name, description, and message entries (number, type, short text, long text)
- Add to `isDdicMetadataType()` for XML PUT updates
- Content-Type: likely `application/vnd.sap.adt.messageclass.v2+xml` (vendor-specific)

### FEAT-48: SKTD (Knowledge Transfer Documents) Read/Write
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — Markdown documentation attached to ABAP objects |
| **Status** | **✅ Completed** — PR #134 by lemaiwo merged 2026-04-16 |
| **Source** | [PR #134](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/134) |

**What:** Read and write SAP Knowledge Transfer Documents (KTDs) — Markdown documentation that can be attached to ABAP objects like CDS views, BDEFs, classes, programs, etc. Editable in Eclipse ADT and stored on the SAP system as XML envelopes with base64-encoded Markdown content.

**ADT endpoints:**
- **Read**: `GET /sap/bc/adt/documentation/ktd/documents/{name}` with `Accept: application/vnd.sap.adt.sktdv2+xml`
- **Create**: `POST /sap/bc/adt/documentation/ktd/documents` (collection URL)
- **Update**: `PUT /sap/bc/adt/documentation/ktd/documents/{name}` with full XML envelope (fetch-modify-PUT pattern preserving server-side metadata)
- **Delete**: Standard ADT delete via lock/delete/unlock
- Name must equal parent object name (SAP rule: one KTD per object)
- Supports multiple `sktd:element` sections (e.g., one per CDS field)

**XML envelope structure:**
```xml
<sktd:docu xmlns:sktd="..." responsible="..." masterLanguage="EN">
  <sktd:refObject type="DDLS/DF" name="ZC_MYBOOKING"/>
  <sktd:element id="...">
    <sktd:text>{base64-encoded Markdown}</sktd:text>
  </sktd:element>
</sktd:docu>
```

**New tool parameters (PR #134):**
- `SAPRead type=SKTD` — returns decoded Markdown (not raw XML/base64)
- `SAPWrite action=create type=SKTD` — requires `refObjectType` (e.g., `DDLS/DF`, `CLAS/OC`, `BDEF/BDO`)
- `SAPWrite action=update type=SKTD` — `source` parameter contains new Markdown

**Why:** LLMs can read and write inline documentation for ABAP objects without leaving the ADT context. Enables AI-assisted documentation workflows: generate KTD for a CDS view, update existing documentation, read KTDs before suggesting changes. Unique to ARC-1 — no other MCP server supports KTDs.

**Why not:** Documentation is authored by humans; LLM-generated KTDs risk low-quality content being committed to SAP systems. KTDs are an Eclipse ADT-specific concept — not widely known or used in all SAP landscapes. Activation required after create/update adds complexity.

### FEAT-49: Current Object Transport Status (legacy `history` action)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — current lock ownership and assignment guidance |
| **Status** | Completed (2026-04-17) |
| **Source** | [fr0ster#30](https://github.com/fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt/issues/30) |
| **Related** | FEAT-20 (revision history), FEAT-24 (diff), transport-level manifest normalization (follow-up) |

**What:** Given an ABAP object (`type` + `name`), report its current parent request lock when present and the requests available for assignment when unlocked. The shipped action remains named `history` for compatibility, but standard ADT does not return complete historical membership. Use `SAPTransport get` when the request id is already known; use an authorized E071/E070 workflow when complete history is genuinely required.

**ADT endpoints (verified 2026-04-17 on A4H):**

1. **Per-object current-lock endpoint (implemented, preferred):**
   - `GET {objectUrl}/transports`
   - Discovered from object structure links: `rel="http://www.sap.com/adt/relations/transport"`
   - Returns `dataname=com.sap.adt.lock.result2`; ARC-1 reads the current parent `CORRNR`
   - For `$TMP`/untracked objects, returns 200 with empty body (normal outcome)

2. **`transportReference` endpoint (not suitable for history payload):**
   - `GET /sap/bc/adt/cts/transportrequests/reference?pgmid=R3TR&obj_wbtype={type}&obj_name={name}`
   - Verified live to resolve object URI link only; does **not** return related transport list
   - Kept as research note, not used for FEAT-49 implementation

3. **`transportchecks` endpoint (implemented fallback):**
   - `POST /sap/bc/adt/cts/transportchecks`
   - Used when `/transports` returns no current lock
   - Surfaces assignment candidates and lock context after package auto-resolution from object structure; candidates do not contain the object

4. **SQL-based E071 query (complete history, deferred):**
   - `SELECT TRKORR FROM E071 WHERE PGMID = 'R3TR' AND OBJECT = '{type}' AND OBJ_NAME = '{name}'`
   - Then resolve task→request hierarchy via E070, optionally map to CR via E070A
   - Source: VSP `handleCRHistory` in `handlers_transport_analysis.go`
   - **Only way to get full transport history** — ADT REST endpoints only return current assignments
   - Requires `SAP_ALLOW_FREE_SQL=true` or data preview access to E071/E070

**Implementation summary (completed):**
- Added the compatibility action `SAPTransport(action="history", type, name)` in `handleSAPTransport`; its documented contract is current lock/assignment status.
- Added `getObjectTransports()` in `src/adt/transport.ts` using `GET {objectUrl}/transports` for the current lock.
- Reused existing `parseTransportInfo()` for `lock.result2` payload parsing.
- Added fallback to `transportchecks` when primary response is empty (package auto-resolved from object metadata).
- Added unit, integration, and E2E coverage plus docs/tool-schema updates.
- Safety model: read-only operation (`OperationType.Read`), no transport write privilege required.

**Why:** This is the missing link that makes FEAT-20 and FEAT-24 actionable. Without knowing *which* transport changed an object, the user can't ask for versioned source or a diff. The fr0ster#30 use case ("code review of the last transport") requires all three features working together. No competitor has the full trio as a cohesive workflow — implementing this puts ARC-1 ahead.

**Why not (deferred scope):** Full historical transport lineage via E071/E070 is intentionally deferred because it depends on free SQL/data-preview access, can conflict with safe defaults, and bypasses some clean per-user ADT authorization boundaries.

### FEAT-50: ADT Probe Fixture Coverage

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | XS per contributed fixture |
| **Risk** | None (diagnostic-only; fixtures are recorded bytes, not product behavior) |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — each fixture permanently hardens [`classifyVerdict`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/src/probe/runner.ts) against regressions on that product line |
| **Status** | Ongoing / contributor-driven |
| **Source** | Issue [#162](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/162), PR [#163](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/163), PR [#170](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/170) |
| **Related** | [`docs/probe-adt-types.md`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/probe-adt-types.md) |

**What:** Grow the set of recorded fixtures that [`tests/unit/probe/replay.test.ts`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/tests/unit/probe/replay.test.ts) runs against, so the probe classifier is regression-tested against the full variety of real SAP landscapes rather than a handful of hand-picked systems. Each fixture is ~40 JSON files totaling <1 MB and requires no live SAP connection in CI.

**Currently covered:**
- `synthetic-752` — hand-crafted 7.52 fixture, covers every `classifyVerdict` decision branch (the #94 HTTP-400 regression guard lives here)
- `s4hana-2023-onprem-abap-trial` — SAP_BASIS 758 + S4FND 108 (ABAP developer trial, RAP-complete)
- `npl-750-sp02-dev-edition` — NPL 7.50 SP02 developer edition (classic ABAP, RAP absent)
- `ecc-ehp8-nw750-sp31-onprem-prod` — productive ECC 6.0 EhP8 on NW 7.50 SP31 (DDLS/DCLS via known-object despite collection 500s)

**Gaps worth filling (ordered by classifier value):**

| # | System | Why it matters for the classifier |
|---|--------|-----------------------------------|
| 1 | **BTP ABAP Environment (Steampunk)** | Cloud-only shape: `SAP_CLOUD` component, different discovery surface, RAP-first, some classic endpoints 404. Exercises the `hasCloud → btp` systemType branch and cloud-specific endpoint patterns no current fixture hits. |
| 2 | **S/4HANA Public Cloud, Embedded Steampunk** | Released/restricted ABAP Cloud. Many legacy types should come back `unavailable-high` from 404, but RAP types should be `available-high`. Validates the "modern Cloud rejects classic, accepts RAP" polarity. |
| 3 | **S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition** | Between on-prem S/4 and Public Cloud; same BASIS line as on-prem but with cloud-only traits. Tells us whether classifier behaves consistently across the S/4 family. |
| 4 | **Plain NetWeaver productive (non-ERP)** — SolMan 7.2, GRC, PI/PO, CRM 7, SRM | Real productive NW without `SAP_APPL`. Exercises the "no ECC/S/4 product markers" discrimination path and confirms the classifier isn't quietly relying on ECC-shaped responses. |
| 5 | **ECC 6.0 EhP7 (NW 7.40)** | Lower release floor for DDLS (7.40); many real ECC systems still run there. Pins the "release == floor, not above" edge case. |
| 6 | **NetWeaver 7.52 productive** | Would let us shrink the hand-crafted `synthetic-752` to just the branches a real 7.52 doesn't emit, instead of carrying the whole synthetic. |
| 7 | **NetWeaver 7.56 / 7.57** | Fill the gap between `synthetic-752` and `s4hana-2023` (BASIS 758). Catches regressions that only surface at intermediate releases. |
| 8 | **S/4HANA on-prem 2020 / 2021 / 2022** | RAP features evolved across releases; our S/4 coverage currently jumps straight to 2023. Intermediate captures pin the release-floor ordering. |
| 9 | **System with restrictive authorization** (probe user lacks `S_DEVELOP` / `S_ADT_RES`) | Exercises the `auth-blocked` verdict with real 401/403 patterns, not the hand-crafted pair in `synthetic-752`. |
| 10 | **System fronted by SSO / SAML / MFA** (captured via cookie auth from PR [#170](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/170)) | Validates the cookie-auth contribution path end-to-end — meta.json shouldn't leak the session cookie, responses should still be probeable. |

**How to contribute:** See the "How to contribute a fixture set from your own system" section in [docs/probe-adt-types.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/probe-adt-types.md). Each contributed fixture needs a short replay-test block in [`tests/unit/probe/replay.test.ts`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/tests/unit/probe/replay.test.ts) asserting the verdicts the contributor observes on their system — that's what turns the fixture into a permanent regression guard.

**Why P3:** The probe is diagnostic-only; it does not change product behavior. Missing fixtures reduce confidence in classifier stability across SAP landscapes but do not cause user-visible defects. Priority rises if a regression in `classifyVerdict` ships undetected, or if issue [#162](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/162)-style "what types does my system actually support?" questions become a recurring support channel.

### FEAT-55: System Messages (SM02) + Gateway Error Log (/IWFND/ERROR_LOG)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — situational awareness (SM02) and OData/Gateway debugging (IWFND) for AI agents |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-21, PR #174) |
| **Source** | fr0ster v5.0.0 ADT feed reader, issue-level guidance in VSP/dassian trackers |

**What:** Extended `SAPDiagnose` with two new actions that surface standard SAP runtime feeds via ADT:
- `action="system_messages"` — SM02 system messages (list mode; filters: user, from, to, maxResults)
- `action="gateway_errors"` — /IWFND/ERROR_LOG entries (list mode + detail mode via `detailUrl` preferred or `id+errorType`). On-prem only.

**Why:** Closes the last fr0ster-v5-unique diagnostics gap. Before PR #174 ARC-1 had dumps + profiler traces via `SAPDiagnose`; now it has the full set (dumps, traces, system_messages, gateway_errors, quickfix, apply_quickfix). Gateway errors are the primary debugging signal for OData service failures — making them reachable from the LLM closes the loop between "user reports Fiori app error" and "agent finds the call stack in /IWFND/ERROR_LOG".

**Implementation:**
- `src/adt/diagnostics.ts` extended with feed-reader helpers for SM02 and /IWFND/ERROR_LOG.
- New `SAPDiagnose` schema fields: `detailUrl`, `errorType`, `from`, `to`, `sections`, `includeFullText`.
- Dumps action rewritten to return focused chapter sections (`kap0`/`kap3`/…) by default; `includeFullText=true` opt-in returns the full formatted blob (token-saving default).
- Structured JSON response shapes in `src/adt/types.ts`.
- Unit + integration + E2E coverage (`tests/unit/adt/diagnostics.test.ts`, `tests/integration/adt.integration.test.ts`, `tests/e2e/diagnostics.e2e.test.ts`).

### FEAT-56: ADT Type-Availability Probe (Diagnostic)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | None (diagnostic-only, no runtime gating) |
| **Usefulness** | High for support; fuels FEAT-50 contributed fixture coverage |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-20, PR #163) |
| **Source** | Issue #162, PR #93/#96 regression lessons |

**What:** Standalone `npm run probe` CLI that reports per-type ADT availability on any connected SAP system, plus quality metrics showing how much the probe's answers can be trusted.

**Multi-signal classifier:** discovery + collection GET + known-object GET + release floor. The PR #94/#95 regression lesson baked in: only HTTP 404 counts as a hard "not available"; 400/403/405/500 mean "endpoint is there". Fixtures captured via `--save-fixtures` drive replay-based unit tests so classifier decisions are regression-proof.

**Shipped fixtures:** synthetic 7.52 corpus + real NW 7.58 capture. Users can contribute fixture sets from their own systems — see FEAT-50.

**Why diagnostic-only:** Explicit design choice after the RAP probe #93 → #96 regression. The probe reports but never gates runtime behavior.

**Implementation:** `scripts/probe-adt-types.ts`, `src/probe/catalog.ts`, `src/probe/runner.ts`, `src/probe/fixtures.ts`, `tests/unit/probe/replay.test.ts`. See [docs/probe-adt-types.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/probe-adt-types.md).

### FEAT-57: SAPContext Impact — Sibling DDLS/DDLX Consistency Check

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low (additive, bounded, best-effort) |
| **Usefulness** | High — catches a specific high-damage RAP bug class |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-22, PR #177) |

**What:** Additive sibling-consistency pass in `SAPContext(action="impact")` that surfaces the common RAP bug where one DDLS variant has DDLX metadata extensions but a sibling variant in the same package does not — leaving one routing path with missing UI fields.

**Implementation:**
- New helpers in `src/adt/cds-impact.ts` (`deriveSiblingStem`, `isSiblingNameMatch`, `buildSiblingExtensionFinding`).
- New `siblingCheck` (default true) and `siblingMaxCandidates` (default 4, hard cap 10) inputs on `SAPContext`.
- Emits `consistencyHints` + `siblingExtensionAnalysis` when siblings show asymmetric DDLX coverage. Base response remains backward-compatible.
- Guard: stems shorter than 3 chars skip the analysis with a warning so e.g. "Z1" does not trigger a Z* scan of the entire namespace.
- Sibling failures degrade to warnings only; outer catch logs via `logger.debug` so best-effort failures stay diagnosable.

**Why:** Raw "upstream+downstream" dependency dumps don't flag this bug — you only notice it when a user reports "the UI works for customer X but not Y" and tracing the routing path. Detecting it automatically is exactly the kind of workflow-level differentiation the 2026-04-18 research note called out.

### FEAT-58: DTEL v2→v1 Content-Type Fallback + SICF-aware Error Hints

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low (narrow static allowlist, 415-only retry) |
| **Usefulness** | High — fixes DTEL create on older releases + actionable hint on SICF misconfig |
| **Status** | **Completed** (2026-04-20, PR #169) |

**What:** Two compatibility improvements for DTEL create on older SAP releases:
1. **Content-Type fallback** — `src/adt/crud.ts` now has a narrow static `CONTENT_TYPE_FALLBACKS` map; on HTTP 415 the client retries once with the fallback Content-Type (specifically `vnd.sap.adt.dataelements.v2+xml` → `vnd.sap.adt.dataelements.v1+xml` for DTEL). Not a generic retry loop — each entry must be a specific, tested compatibility gap.
2. **`icf-handler-not-bound` error classification** — new SAP-domain category for DTEL create failures caused by a missing SICF node. The hint points operators to SICF activation rather than to SAP authorization.

**Implementation:** `src/adt/crud.ts` (fallback map + 415 retry in both `createObject` and `updateObject`), `src/adt/errors.ts` (new `icf-handler-not-bound` category in `classifySapDomainError`), `src/handlers/intent.ts` (`formatErrorForLLM` routing). Unit tests in `tests/unit/adt/crud.test.ts` and `tests/unit/adt/errors.test.ts`.

### BUG-01: SAPActivate Phantom Success + CLI/Server Alignment (NW 7.50)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — parser changes affect every activation path |
| **Usefulness** | Critical — false "Successfully activated" is worse than a failure |
| **Status** | **In flight** — PR [#179](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/179) (samibouge) open at 2026-04-23 |
| **Source** | Reported on NW 7.50 reproducer against `ZCL_XXX` |

**What:** `SAPActivate` reported "Successfully activated" for an ABAP class that was provably inactive (still failing to compile in Eclipse, visible as inactive in SAP GUI). Five independent parser/handler bugs combined into a silent no-op:

1. **`parseActivationResult` misreads `<ioc:inactiveObjects>` as success** — the response shape with zero `<msg>` elements but several `<ioc:inactiveObjects>` entries was read as "no errors → success". VSP's Go client correctly treats this shape as failure.
2. **`getInactiveObjects` hardcoded to the Cloud endpoint path** — Newer SAP uses `/sap/bc/adt/activation/inactive`; NW 7.50 uses `/sap/bc/adt/activation/inactiveobjects`. The client hardcoded the new path and returned 404 on older systems.
3. **`parseInactiveObjects` only understood the feed-wrapped shape** — NW 7.50 returns a flat `<adtcore:objectReferences>` list; parser returned `[]` for this shape.
4. **`SAPDiagnose syntax` had no `version` parameter** — The low-level `syntaxCheck()` already supported `{ version: 'active' | 'inactive' }` but the MCP tool schema never exposed it, so callers couldn't reach real compile errors on objects with pending changes.
5. **`parseSyntaxCheckResult` missed NW 7.50's `<chkrun:checkMessage>` shape** — Wrong element name and line/column encoded inside `uri="…/source/main#start=LINE,COL"` fragment.

**Why P0:** False-positive activation is the worst possible failure mode — it confidently misleads every downstream consumer (CI, eval suites, LLM agents chaining operations).

**PR #179 fix summary:** inactive-objects detection in parse result (including owning user from `ioc:transport[@_user]`), endpoint fallback, flat-shape parser support, new `version` parameter plumbed through, `<chkrun:checkMessage>` position extraction, and a new `inactiveSyntaxDiagnostic()` primitive invoked on activation failure to append compiler errors from the inactive version.

**Blast radius:** Every activation path (`SAPActivate`, RAP batch activation, E2E suites). Needs the missing E2E regression test the PR description calls out: create a class with a deliberate type error → attempt `SAPActivate` → assert failure → assert the returned message names the user and includes compiler text.

### ARCH-01: Discovery-driven Endpoint Routing

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — touches discovery, intent, tools layers |
| **Usefulness** | High — replaces brittle hard-coded URLs with self-correcting routing |
| **Status** | **Plan ready** — [docs/plans/2026-05-08-discovery-driven-endpoint-routing.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/2026-05-08-discovery-driven-endpoint-routing.md); decision recorded in [docs/adr/0001-discovery-driven-endpoint-routing.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/adr/0001-discovery-driven-endpoint-routing.md) |
| **Blocks** | PR-ε (release-gate cleanup, if any release literals are reintroduced before ARCH-01 lands) |

**What:** Generalize the discovery-driven URL pattern (`resolveTablObjectUrl` already does this for TABL — falls back from `/ddic/tables` to `/ddic/structures` based on what the SAP system publishes in `/sap/bc/adt/discovery`). Extend the same approach to other types where the URL varies across releases or where systems differ in which collections they expose: DOMA, DDLX, BDEF, SRVD, SRVB, ENHO. Adds one helper (`discoveryHasCollection(uri)`) plus a `RESOLVE_RULES` table mapping each type to an ordered candidate-URL list. Eliminates per-version branching in the handler hot path.

**Why P1:** Foundation for replacing brittle release-version literals (`isRelease750()` and similar) anywhere they exist. Also makes the codebase self-correcting across SAP support packs — when SAP back-ports a collection, ARC-1 picks it up automatically. The pattern is already proven in `resolveTablObjectUrl`; this generalizes it.

**Live evidence (captured 2026-04-28 against A4H 758 SP02 + NPL 750 SP02):** A4H discovery publishes `/ddic/{tables, structures, domains, ddlx/sources}, /bo/behaviordefinitions, /businessservices/bindings, /enhancements/{enhoxh, enhoxhb}`. NPL 750 publishes only `/ddic/{structures, dataelements, ddl/sources}, /enhancements/enhoxh, /messageclass, /businesslogicextensions/badis`. Discovery is the precise, machine-readable answer to "is this collection available."

**Empirical input:** [docs/research/2026-05-08-nw750-discovery-gap-analysis.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-05-08-nw750-discovery-gap-analysis.md) — endpoint-by-endpoint inventory contributed by PR [#196](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/196) author.

### PR-ε: Remove Static Release Gates (consumes ARCH-01)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low — purely deletion + swap-in if release literals are reintroduced |
| **Usefulness** | Maintenance — keeps the codebase free of `release < 751` literals once ARCH-01 lands |
| **Status** | **Blocked on ARCH-01.** Currently a placeholder — the static release maps proposed in PR [#196](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/196) were not merged, so there is currently nothing to remove. If any future PR reintroduces release-version branching for endpoint routing, PR-ε replaces it with `resolveSourceUrl` / `filterByDiscovery`. |

**Verification:** Each removal must be paired with a regression test against the NPL-7.50 probe fixture and a 758-class fixture, confirming the routing decision is identical to or better than what the literal would produce.

### FEAT-59: Embeddable Multi-Tenant Server (per-instance `systemType`)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — touches configuration and per-call routing |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — enterprise customers running one MCP gateway for multiple SAP systems |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | fr0ster v6.4.0 (PR #69/#70, 2026-04-20) — per-instance `systemType` on `EmbeddableMcpServer` |

**What:** Let a single ARC-1 instance serve multiple SAP backends with per-instance configuration, including per-instance `systemType` (`auto` / `btp` / `onprem`). Today ARC-1 is "one gateway per SAP system" — scaling to many systems means deploying many instances.

**Why:** Customers with mixed landscapes (dev BTP + prod on-prem + sandbox ECC) want one MCP endpoint per environment, not one per SAP system. fr0ster's v6.4.0 EmbeddableMcpServer pattern is the reference implementation. Principal Propagation already handles per-user identity; per-instance would handle per-system routing.

**Why not:** ARC-1's safety config is global (`allowWrites`, `allowedPackages`, etc.) — multi-tenant requires per-tenant safety gates or a consistent profile per SAP system. Also overlaps with the existing Destination Service pattern on BTP. Likely best implemented as a thin router in front of existing per-system instances rather than rebuilding the core. Reconsider when a customer explicitly asks.

### FEAT-60: CLI/Server Alignment (Shortcut Parity with MCP Tool Schemas)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1-2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low (CLI-only, behind existing `call` generic entry point) |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — reduces "why can't the CLI do X?" support load |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | PR [#179](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/179) matrix |

**What:** The CLI exposes generic `call` + `tools` entry points plus ergonomic shortcuts for some MCP tools, but the shortcuts have drifted from the Zod schemas. PR #179's matrix shows 9 of 12 MCP tools (SAPWrite, SAPNavigate, SAPTransport, SAPGit, SAPContext, SAPLint, SAPManage and the extended actions of SAPRead/SAPDiagnose/SAPActivate) have no shortcut or incomplete shortcut coverage.

**Why:** CLI drift forces users into `call SAPX --arg key=value` syntax for any non-basic operation. This hides capabilities from ad-hoc users and makes the CLI hard to recommend alongside the MCP server.

**Implementation options:**
1. Hand-write the missing shortcuts — faster, but will drift again next time a schema changes.
2. Auto-generate shortcut help (required/optional field hints) from the Zod schemas at build time — slower first cut, but prevents future drift.

**Why not:** CLI usage is minor compared to MCP-first usage (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.). Option 2 adds build-time complexity. Defer if CLI shortcut requests stay sporadic.

**Related follow-up from PR #179:** rename the local `lint` CLI command to `lint-local` or `offline-lint` to free `lint` for the `SAPLint` MCP tool; clean up XML entity residue (`&quot;`, `&gt;`) in `SyntaxMessage.text`.

### FEAT-61: Tool Extension Points (Custom Tools on Top of ARC-1)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | M-L (phased: Phase 0+1 ≈ M, Phase 2 ≈ S, Phase 3 ≈ M, Phase 4 if ever ≈ M) |
| **Risk** | Medium — touches the central tool registration / scope policy / audit path |
| **Usefulness** | Medium-High — unblocks customer-specific tools without forking; the prerequisite for any later marketplace |
| **Status** | Research only — see [docs/research/2026-04-26-tool-extension-points.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-04-26-tool-extension-points.md) |
| **Source** | User-requested 2026-04-26 — reuse ARC-1 plumbing (ADT, HTTP, OData) for in-house tooling |

**What:** A documented, opinionated way for downstream users to add their own MCP tools to an ARC-1 instance and reuse the same building blocks the built-in tools rely on (`AdtClient`, `AdtHttpClient`, `SafetyConfig`, `CachingLayer`, `logger`, typed errors), without forking the repository.

**Why:** Today the only way to add a tool is to fork the repo and edit several files (`tools.ts`, `schemas.ts`, the per-tool handler module + `dispatch.ts`, `policy.ts`, plus tests). Customers with private/internal tools cannot upstream them. A defined extension point keeps the in-tree tool surface focused on the universally useful tools while letting teams extend their own instance.

**Phased plan (recommended):**

1. **Phase 0** — define the public API boundary (`src/public/` or `package.json#exports`). No new feature; just declare what is stable. Prerequisite for everything else.
2. **Phase 1** — internal `ToolRegistry` behind a feature flag. Built-ins register through it. No external behaviour change but the codebase becomes extension-shaped. One built-in (e.g. `SAPManage(action="cache_stats")`) converted end-to-end as a self-test.
3. **Phase 2** — local trusted plugin loader: `ARC1_PLUGINS=/path/to/plugin.js`. Admin-explicit, file-permission-checked, fail-fast on registration errors. Same trust model as any binary the admin runs.
4. **Phase 3 (optional)** — manifest-only plugins (declarative JSON, no JS) for thin endpoint wrappers — safest tier, fits the "I just want to wrap one OData endpoint" case.
5. **Phase 4 (only if asked)** — npm peer-package plugins. Not recommended unless customers explicitly request it; an npm marketplace fights the centralized-gateway model.

**Why not (yet):** ARC-1's value comes from the opinionated central safety/scope/audit pipeline. A poorly-designed plugin API could let a third-party tool bypass `allowWrites`, `allowedPackages`, scope policy, or PP. The research doc lists eight invariants that any plugin API must enforce; getting them right takes time. Deferred to P3 until either (a) a concrete customer asks for it, or (b) the in-tree tool count starts to feel like a marketplace candidate.

**Motivating example (2026-04-26):** the [samibouge NW 7.50 fork](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/compare/main...samibouge:arc-1:feat/nw750-version-fix) is the first concrete case for this feature. 17 of its 18 commits are vanilla upstream candidates (and several are already merged via #179). The 18th — [`8dedcb0`, NW 7.50 dump detail via custom ICF endpoint](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/commit/8dedcb0) — requires installing `ZCL_ARC1_DUMP_HANDLER` on the SAP system, which contradicts ARC-1's "no SAP-side install" principle and would bind upstream to maintaining customer-side ABAP. This is exactly the shape the extension model is meant to absorb: customer keeps the ABAP class in their own repo, ships a small TS plugin that calls `/sap/rest/arc1/dumps` via `client.http.get(...)`, admins opt in via `ARC1_PLUGINS=...`. Full bucketing of the 18 commits and a worked plugin sketch are in [§14 of the research doc](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-04-26-tool-extension-points.md#14-worked-example-samibouge-nw-750-fork--what-fits-what-doesnt).

**Out of scope:** Embedding ARC-1 *into* another app (already deferred as [FEAT-29g](#feat-29) — contradicts the centralized-gateway model). This item is the *opposite* — adding tools *to* an ARC-1 instance.

### FEAT-62: ADT Transaction (`TRAN/T`) Source/Write Support

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Effort** | M |
| **Risk** | Medium — transaction lifecycle needs a separate ADT endpoint, JSON source MIME handling, and type-specific create payloads |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — closes a real ADT parity gap for transaction-code authoring, but endpoint availability is backend-dependent |
| **Status** | ⛔ **HARD BLOCKER (re-confirmed 2026-06-25):** `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/tran` returns 404 on a4h 758 + a4h-2025 816 and is absent from discovery on all three test systems (7.50/758/816) — no backend to implement or verify against. Stays tracked pending a system that exposes the endpoint. See [docs/research/2026-04-28-adt-transaction-source-write.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-04-28-adt-transaction-source-write.md) |
| **Source** | [`jfilak/sapcli` PR #156](https://github.com/jfilak/sapcli/pull/156), merged 2026-04-28 |

**What:** Add on-prem transaction source/lifecycle support for `TRAN/T` through `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/tran`, while preserving existing metadata-only `SAPRead(type="TRAN")` through `/sap/bc/adt/vit/wb/object_type/trant/object_name/{name}`.

**Why:** ARC-1 currently returns transaction description/package and optionally `TSTC` program metadata, but cannot read/write the JSON transaction source or create/update/delete transaction objects. sapcli now has a concrete implementation: `TRAN/T`, `blue:blueSource`, JSON `source/main`, and base64-encoded server-driven creation JSON in `blue:additionalCreationProperties`.

**Implementation notes:**
1. Keep current VIT metadata read as the default `SAPRead(type="TRAN")` behavior.
2. Add explicit source read/write support for systems that expose `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/tran`.
3. Add `TRAN/T` type normalization and make lifecycle object URLs use the real transaction endpoint, not the VIT endpoint.
4. Make source writes MIME-aware so `TRAN` uses `application/json` while ABAP source objects keep `text/plain`.
5. Add a transaction create definition for report, parameter, dialog, OO, and variant transaction kinds, then embed compact JSON as base64 `application/vnd.sap.adt.serverdriven.content.v1+json`.
6. Skip ABAP lint/checkruns for transaction JSON; validate JSON locally and let SAP validate semantic references.
7. Feature-detect endpoint support through discovery/probe and return an explicit backend-unsupported message when VIT metadata exists but `/aps/iam/tran` does not.

**Research result:** Live read-only probes against the configured 7.58 systems returned 200 for VIT metadata (`adtcore:type="TRAN/T"`) but 404 for `/sap/bc/adt/aps/iam/tran`, `/SE38`, and `/SE38/source/main`; discovery did not list the endpoint. The NPL 7.50 profile was reachable but returned 401 for both VIT and `/aps/iam/tran`; the existing real NPL 7.50 SP02 fixture also does not list `/aps/iam/tran` in discovery. This means the implementation must be feature-detected and fixture-heavy until a backend exposing the endpoint is available.

**Why not immediately universal:** `TRAN/T` is not available on BTP in ARC-1 today and should remain excluded there. Even on on-prem, tested systems may expose only the VIT metadata endpoint. A naive replacement of `objectBasePath('TRAN')` would break existing metadata reads and produce confusing 404s.

### FEAT-05: Code Refactoring (Rename, Extract Method)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | L (1-2 weeks) |
| **Risk** | Medium — complex ADT API interactions |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — valuable but complex |
| **Status** | Partially complete — change package implemented (2026-04-15); rename/extract remain future |

**What:** ADT supports code refactoring operations (rename symbol, extract method, change package). The marcellourbani/abap-adt-api TypeScript library implements these.

**Progress:** Change package assignment is implemented as `SAPManage(action="change_package")` — moves objects between packages via `/sap/bc/adt/refactorings` preview+execute flow. Supports transport auto-detection, package allowlists on both source and target.

**Why not (rename/extract):** Massive implementation burden for marginal value — rename requires cross-system impact analysis (all callers, dynamic references); extract method requires parsing dependencies, detecting side effects, validating signatures. Both need multi-step ADT lock/unlock cycles with rollback semantics. LLMs are better at writing new methods than surgically extracting from existing ones — `SAPWrite edit_method` already lets the LLM replace a method body. Eclipse ADT and VS Code already have mature refactoring tools that humans prefer for this workflow.

**Competitive update (2026-04-08):** VSP added rename preview analysis (commit dcaa358, Apr 6). Shows what would change without performing the rename. abap-adt-api has full rename (3 methods).

### FEAT-29: P3 Backlog (Future / Niche)

The following features are tracked but not planned for near-term implementation. They are niche, complex, or not aligned with core principles.

| ID | Feature | Why deferred | Why not | Source | Effort |
|----|---------|-------------|---------|--------|--------|
| 29a | SSE transport | Most MCP clients use stdio or HTTP Streamable | Deprecated protocol; HTTP Streamable is the MCP standard | fr0ster | M |
| 29b | ABAP debugger (8+ tools) | Requires WebSocket + ZADT_VSP deployment | Massive scope, requires ABAP-side deployment (violates "no ABAP installation required" principle), niche use case for LLMs | VSP | L |
| 29c | Execute ABAP (IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN) | Security risk — needs careful safety gating | Fundamentally contradicts "safe defaults" principle — executing arbitrary ABAP from an LLM is the highest-risk operation possible | VSP, dassian | S |
| 29d | Call graph analysis (5 tools) | Useful but niche, complex | ADT doesn't expose call graphs directly; would need recursive where-used traversal (expensive, slow). SAPNavigate where-used covers the 80% case | VSP | M |
| 29e | UI5/Fiori BSP CRUD (7 tools) | Only relevant if UI5 detected | Out of scope — ARC-1 is ABAP ADT, not a UI5 deployment tool. BSP repository operations are fragile and version-specific | VSP | M |
| 29f | RFC connectivity (sap-rfc-lite) | Alternative to ADT HTTP, niche | Adds native binary dependency (N-API), breaks pure TypeScript promise, complex cross-platform compilation | fr0ster | M |
| 29g | Embeddable server mode | Library mode for CAP/Express embedding | Contradicts centralized gateway model — embedding in other apps creates unmanaged, unaudited instances | fr0ster | S |
| 29h | Lock registry with recovery | Persist lock state to disk for crash recovery | Over-engineering — SAP's own lock management (SM12) handles orphaned locks. ARC-1 uses `try/finally` for unlock, which is sufficient | fr0ster | M |
| 29i | Language attributes on creation | Multi-language object creation | Extremely niche — most ABAP objects are created in the system's default language | [abap-adt-api eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/ffa43d7-language-attributes.md) | XS |
| 29j | Lua scripting / WASM compiler | VSP-unique experimental, not core MCP value | Experimental, not aligned with MCP standard, no enterprise demand | VSP | N/A |
| 29k | Dead code analysis | Method-level dead code via where-used | SAPNavigate where-used already provides the data; dead code determination is a heuristic that needs human judgment | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/1ecafe7-dead-code-analysis.md) | S |
| 29l | Package health analysis | Aggregated test coverage + staleness + complexity | Composite metric without clear definition; each component (tests, where-used, complexity) is already available individually | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/74efe5e-health-analysis.md) | M |
| 29m | Side effect / LUW classification | Classify methods by mutation profile | Requires runtime analysis or deep static analysis that ADT doesn't support; LLMs can infer side effects from reading the code | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/11c2253-side-effects-luw.md) | M |
| 29n | Package boundary crossing | Architecture governance: cross-package call analysis | SAPNavigate where-used + package filter already covers this; dedicated tool adds marginal value over combining existing tools | [VSP eval](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/53fb790-boundary-crossing.md) | M |

### OPS-03: Multi-System Routing
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | L (1-2 weeks) |
| **Risk** | Medium — significant architecture change |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — needed for enterprises with multiple SAP systems |
| **Status** | Experimental v1 implemented behind `ARC1_MULTI_TARGET_ENDPOINTS` |

**What:** Support many BTP subaccount destinations from one ARC-1 instance. Every accepted target gets
a pinned `/<SYSTEM-OR-ALIAS>/<CLIENT>/mcp` route; `/multi/mcp` adds a required `target` argument to each
SAP-contacting tool. Destinations are discovered at startup when they explicitly set
`arc1.enabled=true`. An optional public route alias handles independently installed systems that
reuse one real SID/client without changing their SAP identity.

**Why:** Enterprises have multiple SAP systems (DEV, QAS, PRD, sandboxes).

**V1 boundary:** This is a default-off BTP/CF exception to the one-target recommendation, not a new
general deployment default. It is XSUAA-only, mutation-free, cache-free, and supports source/metadata
reads plus separately opted-in data preview and SQL. Principal Propagation remains recommended.
[ADR-0007](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/adr/0007-shared-basic-identity-for-read-only-multi-target.md) permits only an
explicit, default-off shared Basic identity under its mutation-free, one-instance controls and never
as a PP fallback. There are no per-target XSUAA roles; separate instances or the MCP hub remain the
answer for writes, pre-SAP target ACLs, or hard failure/security isolation. See
[ADR-0006](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-experimental-read-only-multi-target.md) and the
[administrator guide](multi-target-administration.md).
Start with the [multi-system setup runbook](multi-target-setup.md).
Future work—including target-specific authorization, Principal Propagation-only pinned writes,
read-only parity, fairness, caching, and controlled refresh—is sequenced in the
[multi-target v2 roadmap](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/multi-target-v2-roadmap.md).
It is a planning document, not part of the current v1 contract.

### OPS-05: SAP Cloud Logging (OpenTelemetry) observability
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | M |
| **Risk** | Low — additive; ARC-1 logs to stderr regardless |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Optionally bind/emit to **SAP Cloud Logging** (OpenTelemetry-based logs, metrics, traces) as the managed observability backend, replacing the deprecated SAP Application Logging Service.

**Why:** SAP removed the Application Logging Service from the list of Eligible Cloud Services on 2025-07-31 (SAP Note 3557260). ARC-1 already ships that service `active: false` and works on `cf logs` alone; Cloud Logging is the forward-looking managed stack for customers who want aggregation/dashboards.

**Why not yet:** Larger than the off-by-default toggle already shipped — needs a Cloud Logging service binding, an OTLP exporter, and config plumbing. Tracked separately from the XSUAA→AMS authorization migration (a different deprecation often conflated with this one).

<a id="feat-66"></a>
### FEAT-66: Interactive destructive-op confirmation (on MCP 2026-07-28 elicitation)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P3 |
| **Effort** | S |
| **Risk** | Medium — safety-adjacent UX; must not weaken the config ceiling |
| **Status** | Not started — gated on SDK v2 stable + a client trigger ([ADR-0006](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-mcp-legacy-era-until-triggers.md)) |

**What:** Optional interactive confirmation for destructive operations (delete, transport release), built on MCP 2026-07-28's pull-based elicitation (`inputRequired` / multi-round-trip), surfacing a human OK to the LLM client before the mutation runs.

**Why:** A confirmation step is genuine UX value for irreversible ops and a capability some competitors (dassian-adt) expose. The former `src/server/elicit.ts` helpers (`confirmDestructive`/`selectOption`/`promptString`) were removed in PR #601 because they were never wired, **failed open** (returned "proceed" whenever the client lacked the elicitation capability or on any error), and targeted the `elicitInput` API that 2026-07-28 replaces.

**Why not yet:** Blocked on the SDK v2 / 2026-07-28 migration (ADR-0006). Building it on the old `elicitInput` API now is throwaway work, and no target client needs it today.

**Design constraints — do NOT repeat the removed helpers' mistakes:**
- **Fail closed, not open.** If the client cannot elicit, block the op (or defer to the config gate) — never default to "proceed."
- **Complement to the ceiling, not a replacement.** The server-side config ceiling (`allowWrites` / `allowedPackages` / `denyActions`) stays the primary control; elicitation is an extra human checkpoint, never the only one.
- **Never inside a lock block.** Per the AGENTS.md invariant / ADR-0006, `lock→modify→unlock` stays one synchronous step — elicit *before* acquiring the lock, since MRTR ends and resumes the tool call.
- Reuse the live plugin `ctx.elicit` plumbing (`src/server/plugin-loader.ts`) rather than reviving a parallel helper module.

### SEC-01: Principal Propagation — Per-User SAP Authentication
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Effort** | L (1-2 weeks: code wiring + SAP admin setup + testing) |
| **Risk** | Medium — requires SAP Basis admin (STRUST, CERTRULE, ICM profile) |
| **Usefulness** | Critical — enables per-user SAP authorization and audit trail |
| **Status** | Code complete (2026-03-27) — needs SAP-side setup (STRUST, CERTRULE, ICM) for end-to-end testing |

**Implemented (2026-03-27) — BTP Cloud Connector approach (SEC-02 merged into SEC-01):**
- `lookupDestinationWithUserToken()` in `src/adt/btp.ts` — calls Destination Service "Find Destination" API with `X-User-Token` header
- Per-request ADT client creation in `src/server/server.ts` — `createPerUserClient()` creates a fresh ADT client for each authenticated user
- `SAP-Connectivity-Authentication` header injection in `src/adt/http.ts` — carries SAML assertion to Cloud Connector
- `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` config flag — opt-in for principal propagation
- Fail-closed PP boundary — if a per-user JWT lookup fails, return an error without changing to the shared service account
- No basic auth when PP active — username/password cleared, user identity from SAML assertion only
- 7 unit tests (5 BTP PP destination + 2 HTTP header injection)

**Architecture flow:**
1. User authenticates via XSUAA/OIDC -> JWT token
2. MCP SDK passes `authInfo.token` to tool handler
3. ARC-1 calls Destination Service with `X-User-Token: <jwt>` header
4. Destination Service generates per-user auth tokens (SAML assertion)
5. ADT client sends `SAP-Connectivity-Authentication` header via connectivity proxy
6. Cloud Connector generates X.509 cert -> CERTRULE -> SAP user
7. SAP enforces `S_DEVELOP` authorization per user

**SAP-side setup required (not yet done):**
1. BTP Destination: Change authentication from `BasicAuthentication` to `PrincipalPropagation`
2. Cloud Connector: Synchronize trust with BTP subaccount, set principal type to X.509
3. SAP backend: STRUST (import Cloud Connector CA), CERTRULE, ICM params
4. Subject pattern: Map `${email}` or `${user_name}` to SAP user ID

<a id="sec-02"></a>
### SEC-02: BTP Cloud Connector Principal Propagation
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Status** | Merged into SEC-01 (2026-03-27) — code complete, SAP-side setup pending |

**Merged:** SEC-02 was implemented as part of SEC-01. The BTP Cloud Connector approach was chosen over direct X.509 cert generation because it leverages existing BTP infrastructure and requires less code in ARC-1. See SEC-01 for implementation details.

---

<a id="sec-03"></a>
### SEC-03: SAP Authorization Object Awareness (S_DEVELOP)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Status** | Completed via FEAT-16 (2026-04-15) |

**Merged:** SEC-03's scope (parsing 403 authorization errors, mapping to S_DEVELOP/S_ADT_RES objects, suggesting SU53/PFCG) is fully implemented as part of FEAT-16 Error Intelligence. FEAT-16 now adds SAP-domain error classification and transaction-aware hints across 403/409/423 + activation/dependency scenarios.

<a id="sec-04"></a>
### SEC-04: Audit Logging
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | M (3-5 days) |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-04-01) — multi-sink audit system with BTP Audit Log Service |

**Implemented:**
- `src/server/audit.ts` — central audit logger with pluggable sinks
- `src/server/sinks/stderr.ts` — stderr sink (default)
- `src/server/sinks/file.ts` — file sink for persistent audit trail
- `src/server/sinks/btp-auditlog.ts` — BTP Audit Log Service sink (enterprise compliance)
- User identity (userName, email, clientId) logged with every tool call
- Structured logger with text/JSON output and sensitive field redaction

**References:**
- [OWASP: MCP Server Security - Logging](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/a-practical-guide-for-secure-mcp-server-development/)

<a id="sec-06"></a>
### SEC-06: MCP Client Tool Restriction by User Role
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Status** | Complete via scope enforcement (2026-03-27) |

**Implemented (2026-03-27):**
- `ACTION_POLICY` map in `src/authz/policy.ts` — each tool/action requires a scope
- Scope enforcement in `handleToolCall()` — checks `authInfo.scopes` before executing any tool
- `ListTools` filtering in `src/server/server.ts` — users only see tools they have scopes for
- XSUAA role collections (ARC-1 Viewer/Editor/Admin) map to scopes via `xs-security.json`
- Additive to safety system — both scope check AND safety check must pass
- Backward compatible — no authInfo (stdio, simple API key) = no scope enforcement
- 12 unit tests covering all scope enforcement scenarios

**How it works:**
- `read` scope -> SAPRead, SAPSearch, SAPQuery, SAPNavigate, SAPContext, SAPLint, SAPDiagnose (7 tools)
- `write` scope -> adds SAPWrite, SAPActivate, SAPManage (10 tools)
- `admin` scope -> adds SAPTransport (+ SAPGit when backend is available; up to 12 tools total)
- XSUAA role collections assign scopes to users via BTP cockpit

**Why this matters for basis admins:**
- An SAP developer user (with full S_DEVELOP in Eclipse) can be restricted to read-only via AI
- The admin controls AI capabilities separately from SAP authorization
- **This is unique to ARC-1** — no other MCP server offers scope-based tool filtering

### SEC-07: XSUAA OAuth Proxy for MCP-Native Clients (Claude, Cursor, MCP Inspector)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-03-27) |

**Implemented:**
- MCP SDK's `ProxyOAuthServerProvider` proxies OAuth flow to XSUAA
- `@sap/xssec` v4.13+ for SAP-specific JWT validation (offline, JWKS cached)
- HTTP server refactored from `node:http` to Express 5 (required by MCP SDK auth)
- RFC 8414 discovery at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- In-memory client store for dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
- Chained token verifier: XSUAA -> generic OIDC -> API key (all coexist)
- `xs-security.json` with read/write/admin scopes and 3 role collections
- XSUAA service instance created and bound on BTP CF
- Configuration: `SAP_XSUAA_AUTH=true` enables the proxy

**Files:**
- `src/server/xsuaa.ts` — OAuth provider, client store, chained verifier
- `src/server/http.ts` — Express-based HTTP server with auth routing
- `xs-security.json` — XSUAA service instance config
- `docs/xsuaa-setup.md` — Setup guide

### SEC-08: OAuth Security Hardening (RFC 9700 Compliance)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P0 |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-04-08) |

**Implemented (2026-04-08):**

Based on independent security review against RFC 9700 ([2026-04-08-001-oauth-security-review-verification.md](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/plans/completed/2026-04-08-001-oauth-security-review-verification.md)):

- **F-01 (High):** Added `state` + PKCE (S256) to BTP browser OAuth flow — prevents authorization code injection and login CSRF
- **F-02 (High):** Bound OAuth callback server to `127.0.0.1` — prevents network-adjacent callback interception
- **F-04 (High):** Made `SAP_OIDC_AUDIENCE` mandatory when `SAP_OIDC_ISSUER` is set — prevents cross-service token confusion
- **F-10 (Medium):** HTML-escaped `error_description` in callback + added `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'` headers
- **F-07 (Medium):** Replaced `exec()` with `execFile()` in browser opener — eliminates shell injection surface
- **F-05 (Medium):** Added `revokeToken` override to `XsuaaProxyOAuthProvider` — uses correct XSUAA credentials
- **F-06 (Medium):** Added redirect URI policy, 100-client cap, and 24h TTL to DCR client store. Superseded by stateless DCR (see SEC-09 below) — the cap was removed (no shared memory state to exhaust) and the TTL default raised to 30 days with `--oauth-dcr-ttl-seconds` configuration.
- **F-08 (Low):** Added `requiredClaims: ['exp']` and configurable `SAP_OIDC_CLOCK_TOLERANCE` for JWT validation

### SEC-09: Stateless OAuth DCR (Restart-Resilient `client_id`s)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-05-05, PR #212) |

**Problem:** OAuth Dynamic Client Registration state was held in an in-memory `Map`. Every container restart wiped the registry, and the next request from a cached `client_id` returned `400 invalid_client`. On BTP CF Diego this triggered routinely (`cf restart`, `cf push`, `cf restage`, cell evacuation, OOM auto-recovery, lazy 24h TTL eviction). Affected users had to manually clear their MCP client's local OAuth cache.

**Implemented:**

- Replaced `InMemoryClientStore` with `StatelessDcrClientStore`. Each issued `client_id` is an HMAC-signed token carrying its own registration payload — `getClient()` re-derives state from the signature with no backing store.
- HMAC key is derived (HKDF-style with a `arc1-dcr/v1` domain-separation label) from the existing XSUAA `clientsecret` so any process with the same service binding can validate any `client_id` ever issued. Multi-instance scale-out works for free.
- Default TTL raised from 24h → 30d (matches typical OAuth refresh-token lifetime; eliminates the daily "re-authenticate" UX pain for Copilot users). Configurable via `--oauth-dcr-ttl-seconds` / `ARC1_OAUTH_DCR_TTL_SECONDS`, clamped to `[60s, 90d]`.
- DCR lifecycle now flows through the audit pipeline: `oauth_client_registered`, `oauth_client_lookup_failed` (with `unknown_prefix` / `malformed` / `bad_signature` / `invalid_payload` / `expired` reasons), `oauth_redirect_uri_registered`. Forgery / probing is observable.

**Tradeoffs:**

- Per-client revocation is impossible (only TTL or full key rotation via `cf bind-service`).
- Loose-match for redirect_uri encoding variants (BAS/Cline `?` ↔ `%3F`) is gone — affected clients re-register on encoding mismatch.
- Service-binding rotation invalidates every outstanding DCR `client_id` at once, including in-flight refresh tokens.

**Files:**
- `src/server/stateless-client-store.ts` — NEW signed-token store
- `src/server/xsuaa.ts` — wire-up, removed `InMemoryClientStore`
- `src/server/audit.ts` — three new event types
- `src/server/config.ts`, `src/server/types.ts`, `src/server/http.ts` — `oauthDcrTtlSeconds` config
- `docs_page/xsuaa-setup.md` — Stateless DCR section, service-binding rotation procedure, audit-event reference

### SEC-15: Durable OAuth DCR Signing-Key Lifecycle

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Effort** | L (phased; excludes an optional stateful DCR registry) |
| **Status** | Research complete; architecture and live CF lifecycle decision open |

**Problem:** SEC-09 made registrations stateless and restart-resilient, but the signing key became
the effective registration database. ARC-1 currently either derives it from the XSUAA binding
secret or asks an administrator to set `ARC1_DCR_SIGNING_SECRET` after deployment. The former
couples DCR continuity to binding replacement; the latter is a manual secret-delivery path that
Cloud Foundry does not recommend for credentials. PR
[#607](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/607) proposed reading a key from any matching
`VCAP_SERVICES` entry, but its first-match selection, blank-value precedence, and incomplete
lifecycle contract made that trust anchor ambiguous.

**Research and evidence:**

- [Durable OAuth DCR signing-key lifecycle](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/2026-07-31-durable-dcr-signing-key-lifecycle.md)
  — full threat model, eight-option evaluation, decision matrix, provider/key-ring architecture,
  live experiment plan, phased delivery, and acceptance criteria.
- [PR #607 deep review](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/blob/main/docs/research/pull-requests/607-dcr-signing-secret-from-bound-service.md)
  — exact diff/runtime findings and completed repository gates.
- [PR #607](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/607) — closed pending the broader architecture
  decision; the exact named service-binding direction remains in scope.

**Recommended direction:**

1. Define a platform-neutral, startup-resolved key-provider/key-ring contract with safe source and
   key-ID observability.
2. Implement mounted-file support and exact named Cloud Foundry binding selection across all CF
   credential-delivery modes; fail closed for a selected but broken provider.
3. Use an externally owned existing service as the first BTP production profile; retain explicit
   secret and XSUAA derivation only as observable compatibility paths.
4. Treat an MTA-owned generated UPS as a conditional zero-touch profile. Ship it only after entropy,
   in-place deploy, blue-green, scale, rollback, binding change, delete-services, and deployer-version
   tests pass.
5. Add key identifiers and a bounded previous-key verification window before claiming seamless
   rotation or rolling migration.
6. Keep SAP Credential Store and a stateful client registry optional until a customer requirement
   justifies their runtime and operational cost.

**Completion gate:** all acceptance criteria in the research document must pass. In particular,
unrelated service bindings and array order must never select the key; every serving instance must
report the same non-secret key IDs; explicit provider failure must not fall back silently; existing
explicit-secret users need a tested migration; and documentation must distinguish ordinary deploys
from the binding-recreation events that actually rotate XSUAA credentials.

### SEC-10: HTTP Security Headers + Opt-In CORS
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P2 |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-05-05) |

**Problem:** The `http-streamable` transport sent no browser security headers and rejected every browser-originated `fetch()` because there was no CORS handling. That left two gaps: (1) when a browser ever reached `/health`, `/mcp`, or an OAuth endpoint, none of the standard hardening (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, COOP, CORP, …) was in place, and (2) any internal browser UI that wanted to call `/mcp` directly was blocked at the protocol level with no opt-in.

The four shipped MCP clients — Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, Copilot Studio — are all native HTTP and don't trigger CORS, so for the supported deployment shapes the gap was only theoretical. The change closes it for the future browser-UI case while making sure the native-client default path still works (specifically, OAuth popups depend on a `same-origin-allow-popups` COOP, which helmet's default `same-origin` would have broken).

**Implemented:**

- [helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/) middleware on every HTTP response — HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, COOP, CORP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, and the legacy hardening set. Always-on, no flag to disable.
- COOP **disabled** unconditionally (`crossOriginOpenerPolicy: false`). The first attempt set it to `same-origin-allow-popups` thinking that helped OAuth popups, but Microsoft Copilot Studio's connector flow opens `/authorize` in a popup and uses `window.open()` / `postMessage` to receive the redirect — any non-default COOP on `/authorize` (including the lenient `same-origin-allow-popups`) puts the popup in a separate browsing context group, severs the parent's window reference, and surfaces as "consent pop-up window has been closed unexpectedly". Verified live with the BTP test deployment: claude.ai (redirect-flow OAuth) and Cursor (native client) both worked with COOP set; Copilot Studio failed reproducibly. Disabling COOP fixed Copilot Studio without regressing the others. ARC-1 renders no JS UI that would benefit from cross-origin isolation, so the security cost is zero.
- CSP override (when CORS is enabled) uses `useDefaults: true` and only widens `style-src`. Every other directive — `frame-ancestors 'self'`, `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, `form-action 'self'`, `upgrade-insecure-requests`, … — is preserved.
- Opt-in CORS via `--allowed-origins` / `ARC1_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Empty (default) disables CORS entirely. With origins set, exact-match reflection + `credentials: true` + `methods: GET/POST/DELETE/OPTIONS` + `Vary: Origin`.
- New `cors_rejected` audit event fires when a browser request from an unallowed origin reaches the server. Browsers drop the response anyway; this gives a server-side signal for triage.
- `cors` package pinned to exact `2.8.6` (the 2.8.5 → 2.8.6 release closed a 7-year gap; pinned until it stabilizes).
- `applySecurityMiddleware()` extracted from `startHttpServer()` so the helmet/CORS contract is unit-testable via `supertest` without binding ports. New file `tests/unit/server/http-security-headers.test.ts` covers 14 cases (CSP defaults preserved with and without CORS, COOP unconditional, exact-origin reflection, credentials, exposed headers, multi-origin allowlist, audit emission for misses).

**Tradeoffs:**

- HSTS (default `max-age=15552000` + `includeSubDomains`) is durable. Once a browser sees it, the host plus its subdomains are HTTPS-locked for 180 days. Deliberate on BTP CF (apps are HTTPS-only at the gorouter); only a concern for hostnames that might need to serve HTTP later.
- CORS uses `credentials: true`, so wildcards aren't allowed by browser policy. Operators configure exact origins; misconfiguration produces silent browser drops + `cors_rejected` audit events. Documented prominently in the Security Guide.
- Helmet's CSP `script-src 'self'` blocks inline scripts. The MCP SDK's auth router emits only redirects + JSON, so this isn't an issue today; future server-rendered pages would need to either use external scripts or add a nonce.
- One new prod dep (`helmet`, zero deps) and one new pinned prod dep (`cors`, zero deps). Both from established Node maintainers (Evan Hahn, expressjs).

### SEC-11: Dependency & Supply-Chain Security — Tier 1 Foundation
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-05-08) |

**Problem:** Before this work, the repository had no Dependabot, no `npm audit` gate, no GitHub Dependency Review, no SAST in CI for the project itself, no container scanning, and no `SECURITY.md` policy. `npm audit` reported 9 open advisories (2 HIGH, 7 MODERATE) across `path-to-regexp`, `axios` (transitive), `hono`, `@hono/node-server`, `ip-address`, `express-rate-limit`, `fast-xml-parser`, `follow-redirects`, `postcss`. Customers running ARC-1 on regulated landscapes (banks, government, defense) run their own image scanners (Aqua, Prisma Cloud, Microsoft Defender) — vulnerable artifacts get rejected at procurement.

**Implemented (across PRs #227, #229, #234, #235, this PR):**

- **Dependency baseline cleared.** `npm audit fix` + `npm update` resolved all 9 advisories; lockfile rebuilt with 13 in-range packages bumped to latest. `npm audit --audit-level=high` exits 0 today. (PR [#227](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/227))
- **Dependabot config.** `.github/dependabot.yml` — three ecosystems (npm, github-actions, docker), weekly Mondays 06:00 Europe/Berlin, grouping rules (`dev-dependencies`, `types`, `sap-sdk`, `mcp-sdk`, `linting`), ignore rules for `@types/node` major (must match `engines.node`) and Docker `node` major (LTS-only cadence). (PRs [#229](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/229) + [#235](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/235))
- **`npm audit` PR gate.** New step in `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=optional` after `npm ci`, before `npm run lint`. Audits production AND dev deps — a compromised dev dep can poison the published artifact.
- **GitHub Dependency Review.** New `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` runs on every PR, fails on `high`-severity introductions or denied licenses (GPL/AGPL/LGPL deny-list to protect the MIT-licensed npm package).
- **CodeQL SAST.** GitHub Default Setup running JS/TS analysis on every push/PR; findings on the Security tab; `Check runs failure threshold: High or higher` blocks merges with HIGH security alerts.
- **Trivy container scanning.** `.github/workflows/docker.yml` (dev push) runs Trivy non-gating (`exit-code: 0`) and uploads SARIF to the Security tab. `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs Trivy **gating** (`exit-code: 1`) so customers pulling `:vX.Y.Z` get a CVE-clean image.
- **Workflow permissions.** Top-level `permissions: contents: read` on `test.yml`, plus per-job `security-events: write` for SARIF upload paths. Closed 5 of the 12 then-open CodeQL `actions/missing-workflow-permissions` MEDIUM alerts. (PR [#229](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/229))
- **Third-party action SHA pinning.** `googleapis/release-please-action`, `docker/setup-buildx-action`, `docker/login-action`, `docker/metadata-action`, `docker/build-push-action`, `aquasecurity/trivy-action` — all pinned to commit SHAs with trailing `# vN` comments so Dependabot bumps SHA + tag together. Mitigates the [`tj-actions/changed-files` 2024 supply-chain compromise](https://blog.gitguardian.com/tj-actions-changed-files-action-was-compromised/) attack class. GitHub-owned `actions/*` and `github/*` are deliberately tag-pinned.
- **`SECURITY.md` policy.** Vulnerability reporting (GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting + email fallback), severity-tiered response SLAs (3 days ack / 7 days triage / 14 days critical / 30 days high / 60 days moderate), CVE handling (GHSA + CVE via GitHub's CNA), out-of-scope (SAP system bugs route to SAP, upstream-only deps route upstream), Safe Harbor for good-faith research. (PR [#229](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/pull/229))
- **Repo-level GitHub security toggles enabled.** Dependabot alerts + security updates + grouped security updates + version updates + malware alerts; secret scanning + push protection (already on by default for public repos); Private Vulnerability Reporting.

**Tradeoffs:**

- Audit threshold = `high` (not `moderate`). `moderate` produces too much noise from transitive deps for any team that's not monitoring full-time. Critical/HIGH gate; moderate/low surface as warnings on the Security tab.
- Trivy non-gating on dev pushes, gating on releases. Dev iteration shouldn't be blocked by a HIGH CVE in a Node base image that we can't fix until upstream rebuilds; releases need to be CVE-clean before customers pull them.
- Third-party SHA pinning only — `actions/*` and `github/*` stay tag-pinned. They publish from a trusted GitHub-owned org with signed releases; pinning them too generates churn without commensurate security gain.
- CodeQL stays on Default Setup, not Advanced. Default Setup auto-manages the workflow file and bumps queries; Advanced gives more control (`security-extended,security-and-quality` query suite, path-ignore for tests/dist) but has more upkeep. Re-evaluate if the false-positive rate on Default proves untenable.

### SEC-12: XSUAA OAuth `state` Callback Proxy (fixes VS Code "State does not match")
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | P1 |
| **Status** | Complete (2026-06-01, PR #325) |

**Problem:** OAuth login intermittently failed with **"State does not match"** when connecting from VS Code (issue [#214](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/214)). XSUAA echoes a **literal `+`** (not `%2B`) in the `state` it appends to the authorization redirect. Standard base64 `state` values — e.g. VS Code's `randomBytes(16).toString('base64')` — contain `+` ~50% of the time. The receiving client parses the callback query with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` semantics (`+`→space), so the round-tripped `state` no longer matched and login failed about half the time.

Verified empirically against live XSUAA with an [8-scenario spectrum reproducer](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/issues/214#issuecomment-4387683481): `+` is the ONLY character XSUAA mangles (`/`, `=`, alphanumerics survive), and it mangles even when ARC-1 forwards a correctly `%2B`-encoded state — so an ingress-only fix is impossible. ARC-1 was not in the return path (XSUAA redirected directly to the client).

**Implemented:**

- `OAuthStateCodec` (NEW `src/server/oauth-state.ts`) — stateless, HMAC-signed, **base64url** state token (no `+`/`/`, immune to the bug) carrying the client's original `redirect_uri` + `state` + 10-min expiry. Mirrors the stateless DCR design ([SEC-09](#sec-09)): same resolved signing secret, distinct KDF label, survives `cf restart` / scale-out with no in-memory map.
- `XsuaaProxyOAuthProvider.authorize()` sends XSUAA ARC-1's own `/oauth/callback` + the signed token instead of the client's `redirect_uri` + raw `state`.
- New `/oauth/callback` route decodes the token and 302-redirects to the client, re-emitting the original `state` via `URL.searchParams` (encodes `+` as `%2B`). Invalid / expired / forged tokens → `400` (no open redirect — the redirect target lives inside the verified token). Rate-limited like the other OAuth endpoints.
- `exchangeAuthorizationCode()` sends the same `/oauth/callback` so the token-exchange `redirect_uri` matches authorize.

Transparent to every client shape (native loopback, browser redirect, browser popup); each now gets its exact original `state` back. No `xs-security.json` change needed — the callback matches the existing `https://*.hana.ondemand.com/**` / `http://localhost:*/**` wildcards.

**Removal condition (when this workaround can be deleted):** ONLY when **XSUAA stops emitting a literal `+`** (emits `%2B`) for `state`. That is the actual root-cause defect; no public SAP Note tracks it as of 2026-06. Re-run the issue #214 spectrum reproducer against the target tenant to check.

The VS Code client-side issue — [microsoft/vscode#314715](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/314715), asking VS Code to use base64url `state` — would fix the **VS Code symptom only**. Other MCP clients (Cursor, claude.ai, Copilot Studio, …) still send base64 `state` containing `+`, so the callback proxy must stay until the XSUAA-side fix lands. **Do not remove this module just because vscode#314715 closes.**

**Files:**
- `src/server/oauth-state.ts` — NEW signed state codec (removal condition documented at the top)
- `src/server/xsuaa.ts` — `authorize()` + `exchangeAuthorizationCode()` route through `/oauth/callback`
- `src/server/http.ts` — NEW `/oauth/callback` route (exported `createOAuthCallbackHandler`)
- `tests/unit/server/oauth-state.test.ts`, `tests/unit/server/oauth-callback.test.ts` — codec + round-trip proof

## Competitive Landscape

> **Detailed tracking**: See [`docs/compare/`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/tree/main/docs/compare/) for per-commit and per-issue evaluations of key competitors.

| Competitor | Language | Tools | Auth | Safety | Deployment | Key Advantage |
|-----------|---------|-------|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| **ARC-1** | TypeScript | 12 intent-based + hyperfocused | API Key, OIDC, XSUAA, PP | Read-only, pkg filter, deny actions, 3-layer auth (server ceiling + user scopes + SAP auth) | Docker, BTP CF, npm | Per-user PP, scope-based tools, 3 auth modes, safety, 1,500+ tests across unit/integration/E2E |
| **vibing-steampunk** | Go 1.24 | 1-99+ (3 modes) | Basic, Cookie | Op filter, pkg filter, transport guard | Go binary (9 platforms) | 392 stars, **Streamable HTTP (v2.38.0)**, native parser, massive feature sprint (i18n, gCTS, API release state, version history, code coverage) |
| **fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt** | TypeScript | ~330 (v7.2.1, 63★) | 9+ providers (incl. TLS, SAML, Device Flow, **cert/Kerberos**) | Exposition tiers + **DNS-rebinding (v7.2.0)** | npm `@mcp-abap-adt/core` | Most tools, most auth options, embeddable, RFC, multi-system |
| SAP ABAP Add-on MCP | ABAP | ~10 | SAP native | SAP authorization | Runs inside SAP | No proxy needed, SAP-native auth |
| lemaiwo/btp-sap-odata-to-mcp-server | TypeScript | ~10 | XSUAA OAuth proxy | XSUAA roles | BTP CF (MTA) | XSUAA OAuth proxy, principal propagation |
| dassian-adt / abap-mcpb | JavaScript | 25+ | Basic, Browser login | MCP elicitation | Node.js / MCPB | Error intelligence, batch activation, find_definition, edit_method (Apr sprint) |
| AWS ABAP Accelerator | Python | ~15 | OAuth, X.509 | Basic | AWS Lambda | Cloud readiness assessment, migration |

**ARC-1 differentiators (no other project has all of these):**
1. **Intent-based routing** — 12 tools vs 25-287, simplest LLM decision surface
2. **Per-user SAP identity** — BTP Destination Service with Cloud Connector PP for on-premise and `OAuth2UserTokenExchange` for BTP ABAP
3. **Two-dimensional authorization** — scopes (read/write/admin) x roles x safety config, with per-tool filtering
4. **Three auth modes coexist** — XSUAA OAuth + generic OIDC + API key on the same endpoint
5. **Comprehensive safety system** — read-only, package filter, operation filter, transport guard, dry-run — additive to scopes
6. **Multi-sink audit logging** — stderr + file + BTP Audit Log Service
7. **Context compression + method-level surgery** — AST-based 7-30x + 95% method-level reduction
8. **Plugin elicitation (`ctx.elicit`)** — opt-in interactive prompts for extension tools (core safety is the config ceiling)
9. **1,500+ automated tests** with CI on Node 22/24, integration/E2E reliability telemetry, and BTP smoke lane
10. **First-party workflow skills** — researched RAP/common-use-case playbooks that exploit provider-contract guidance, impact/history/context tools, formatter alignment, SKTD docs, and Git context
11. **npm + Docker + release-please** — most professional distribution pipeline
12. **RFC 9700 OAuth security** — state + PKCE, loopback binding, audience validation

**Key competitive threats** (tracked in [`docs/compare/`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/tree/main/docs/compare/)):
1. **vibing-steampunk** (392 stars) — community favorite. **Major threat escalation (Apr 2026)**: massive sprint added Streamable HTTP, API release state, i18n (7 tools), gCTS (10 tools), version history, code coverage, health analysis, rename preview, dead code analysis, CDS impact, and recovery primitives. ARC-1 has now closed the prioritized gCTS/abapGit gap via FEAT-22, but VSP remains strong on breadth and release velocity.
2. **fr0ster** (v7.2.1, 120+ releases, 63 stars) — closest enterprise competitor; doubled its stars since April. Q2 sprint added SearchSource (package source grep), RuntimeRunClass + profiling, certificate/Kerberos auth, function-group include CRUD, and — notably — **DNS-rebinding protection (v7.2.0)**, the one security control ARC-1 currently lacks (→ **SEC-14**). 9+ auth providers, TLS, RFC, embeddable. Watch for convergence on enterprise **and security** features.
3. **dassian-adt / abap-mcpb** (33 stars, 53 tools) — fast April sprint added OAuth/XSUAA, multi-system support, more transport tooling, trace flows, and test/include helpers. No safety system is still a major gap, but the pace is notable.
4. **btp-odata-mcp** (120 stars) — different category (OData) but high adoption. Could expand into ADT territory.

## Update History

| Date | Update |
|------|--------|
| 2026-06-26 | DDIC structure context + docs audit. `SAPContext(action="structure", type="TABL")` now returns recursive DDIC include trees plus append/extension structures, with A4H 2025 where-used fallback. The roadmap and feature matrix ARC-1 column were re-audited against current repo facts: MCP OAuth/DCR, dry-run scope, RAP preflight, AUnit coverage, diagnostics/DDIC coverage, and test counts. |
| 2026-06-25 | Shipped the 2026-06-24 deep-scan gaps in 8 PRs, each live-verified on a4h 758 (S/4HANA 2023) and a4h-2025 816 (ABAP Platform 2025): FEAT-63 pre-release inactive-objects check + COMPAT-05 K/W/T fix (PR #501), FEAT-64 unknown-column hint (PR #502), FEAT-41 AUnit coverage (PR #503), FEAT-65 TTYP read+create (PR #504), FUGR structural-include write (PR #505), CDS API-release write via `SAPManage set_api_state` (PR #506), and RAP behavior-extension create (PR #507). SEC-14 was implemented then deferred in PR #500 because mandatory HTTP auth is the primary control. FEAT-62 (TRAN write) remains hard-blocked because `/aps/iam/tran` is absent on all three test systems. |
| 2026-06-24 | Competitor deep scan of fr0ster v7.2.1, sapcli, and dassian-adt found SEC-14, FEAT-63, FEAT-64, FEAT-65, COMPAT-05, and a dual-signal CDS API-release-write gap. It also reinforced FEAT-41 and FEAT-62 with sapcli reference implementations. See [`docs/compare/`](https://github.com/arc-mcp/arc-1/tree/main/docs/compare/). |
| 2026-05-29 | Added SAPRead `grep`: case-insensitive regex over source-bearing types, returning matching lines with line numbers and context, class method annotations, and literal fallback. Complements issue #307 class-section surgery and closes issue #313. |
| Earlier | Added the ARC-1-native pre-write hint `arc1-tabl-draft-admin-include`, SAPSearch `tadir_lookup` source modes for TADIR ghost detection, SAPWrite `batch_create activateAtEnd` for interdependent RAP graphs, and the RAP handler skeleton CCIMP-only fix. |
