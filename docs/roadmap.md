# ARC-1 Roadmap

**Last Updated:** 2026-04-04
**Project:** ARC-1 (ABAP Relay Connector) — MCP Server for SAP ABAP Systems
**Repository:** https://github.com/marianfoo/arc-1

---

## Vision

Every other SAP MCP server today runs on the developer's local machine — unmanaged, unaudited, with whatever permissions the developer happens to have. There is no admin oversight, no token budget control, no audit trail, and no way to restrict what an LLM can do to an SAP system.

**ARC-1 is different.** It is a **centralized, admin-controlled MCP gateway** deployed on BTP Cloud Foundry or a company server (Docker). One instance per SAP system, serving multiple users. The admin controls which tools are exposed, which packages can be touched, and whether writes are allowed — before any LLM request reaches SAP.

### Core Design Principles

1. **Centralized admin control** — ARC-1 runs as a managed service, not on developer laptops. Admins configure safety gates (read-only, package allowlists, operation filters, SQL blocking, transport guards) per instance. Every tool call is audited with user identity. Developers and LLMs operate within guardrails set by the organization — not by individual choice.

2. **Per-user SAP identity** — Principal propagation maps each MCP user to their own SAP user via BTP Destination Service + Cloud Connector. SAP's native authorization (S_DEVELOP, package checks) applies per user. No shared service accounts, no credential leakage. The LLM acts with exactly the permissions the SAP user has — nothing more.

3. **Token-efficient tool design** — 11 intent-based tools (~5K schema tokens) instead of 200+ individual endpoints. This isn't just cleaner — it's the difference between working and not working on mid-tier LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Gemini Flash, Copilot Studio). Hyperfocused mode reduces to 1 tool (~200 tokens). Method-level surgery and context compression (7-30x) keep responses within tight context windows.

4. **BTP-native deployment** — Designed for SAP BTP Cloud Foundry with Destination Service, Cloud Connector, XSUAA OAuth, and BTP Audit Log Service. Also deployable as Docker on any server. Local stdio mode is supported for development and testing, but the production target is always a centralized instance.

5. **Multi-client, vendor-neutral** — Works with any MCP-compatible client: Claude Code/Desktop, Microsoft Copilot Studio, VS Code (GitHub Copilot), Gemini CLI, Cursor, and others. The same ARC-1 instance serves all of them. Three auth modes coexist (XSUAA + OIDC/Entra ID + API key) so different client types connect through the same gateway.

6. **Safe defaults, opt-in power** — Read-only by default. Free SQL blocked by default. No write operations until the admin explicitly enables them. This inverts the model of every other MCP server where everything is allowed until someone thinks to restrict it.

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

### SEC-01: Principal Propagation — Per-User SAP Authentication
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🔴 P0 |
| **Effort** | L (1–2 weeks: code wiring + SAP admin setup + testing) |
| **Risk** | Medium — requires SAP Basis admin (STRUST, CERTRULE, ICM profile) |
| **Usefulness** | Critical — enables per-user SAP authorization and audit trail |
| **Status** | ✅ Code complete (2026-03-27) — needs SAP-side setup (STRUST, CERTRULE, ICM) for end-to-end testing |

**Implemented (2026-03-27) — BTP Cloud Connector approach (SEC-02 merged into SEC-01):**
- `lookupDestinationWithUserToken()` in `src/adt/btp.ts` — calls Destination Service "Find Destination" API with `X-User-Token` header
- Per-request ADT client creation in `src/server/server.ts` — `createPerUserClient()` creates a fresh ADT client for each authenticated user
- `SAP-Connectivity-Authentication` header injection in `src/adt/http.ts` — carries SAML assertion to Cloud Connector
- `SAP_PP_ENABLED=true` config flag — opt-in for principal propagation
- Graceful fallback — if per-user lookup fails, falls back to shared service account
- No basic auth when PP active — username/password cleared, user identity from SAML assertion only
- 7 unit tests (5 BTP PP destination + 2 HTTP header injection)

**Architecture flow:**
1. User authenticates via XSUAA/OIDC → JWT token
2. MCP SDK passes `authInfo.token` to tool handler
3. ARC-1 calls Destination Service with `X-User-Token: <jwt>` header
4. Destination Service generates per-user auth tokens (SAML assertion)
5. ADT client sends `SAP-Connectivity-Authentication` header via connectivity proxy
6. Cloud Connector generates X.509 cert → CERTRULE → SAP user
7. SAP enforces `S_DEVELOP` authorization per user

**SAP-side setup required (not yet done):**
1. BTP Destination: Change authentication from `BasicAuthentication` to `PrincipalPropagation`
2. Cloud Connector: Synchronize trust with BTP subaccount, set principal type to X.509
3. SAP backend: STRUST (import Cloud Connector CA), CERTRULE, ICM params
4. Subject pattern: Map `${email}` or `${user_name}` to SAP user ID

### SEC-02: BTP Cloud Connector Principal Propagation
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | — |
| **Risk** | — |
| **Usefulness** | High — enables per-user auth when ARC-1 runs on BTP CF |
| **Status** | ✅ Merged into SEC-01 (2026-03-27) — code complete, SAP-side setup pending |

**Merged:** SEC-02 was implemented as part of SEC-01. The BTP Cloud Connector approach was chosen over direct X.509 cert generation because it leverages existing BTP infrastructure and requires less code in ARC-1. See SEC-01 for implementation details.

---

### SEC-03: SAP Authorization Object Awareness (S_DEVELOP)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | — |
| **Effort** | — |
| **Risk** | — |
| **Usefulness** | — |
| **Status** | ✅ Subsumed by FEAT-16 (Error Intelligence) |

**Merged:** SEC-03's scope (parsing 403 authorization errors, mapping to S_DEVELOP objects, suggesting SU53/PFCG) is now part of FEAT-16 Error Intelligence, which covers all SAP error codes (403, 409, 423, 415) with actionable hints. See FEAT-16 for details.

---

### SEC-04: Audit Logging
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | M (3–5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — required for enterprise compliance |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete (2026-04-01) — multi-sink audit system with BTP Audit Log Service |

**Implemented:**
- `src/server/audit.ts` — central audit logger with pluggable sinks
- `src/server/sinks/stderr.ts` — stderr sink (default)
- `src/server/sinks/file.ts` — file sink for persistent audit trail
- `src/server/sinks/btp-auditlog.ts` — BTP Audit Log Service sink (enterprise compliance)
- User identity (userName, email, clientId) logged with every tool call
- Elicitation events (confirmations, user choices) logged
- Structured logger with text/JSON output and sensitive field redaction

---

### SEC-05: Rate Limiting
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — prevents runaway AI loops from overwhelming SAP |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Token bucket rate limiter per MCP session, configurable via env var. Prevents an AI agent in a retry loop from generating thousands of SAP API calls per minute.

**Configuration:**
```bash
SAP_RATE_LIMIT=60        # requests per minute per session (0 = unlimited)
SAP_RATE_LIMIT_BURST=10  # burst allowance
```

**Implementation:**
- Use `rate-limiter-flexible` npm package or simple in-memory token bucket
- Per-session limiter (keyed by MCP session ID or OIDC user)
- Return MCP error with retry-after hint when rate limited

---

### SEC-06: MCP Client Tool Restriction by User Role
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3–5 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — needs careful design |
| **Usefulness** | High — differentiates AI usage from Eclipse/ADT usage |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete via scope enforcement (2026-03-27) |

**Implemented (2026-03-27):**
- `TOOL_SCOPES` map in `src/handlers/intent.ts` — each tool requires a scope (read/write/admin)
- Scope enforcement in `handleToolCall()` — checks `authInfo.scopes` before executing any tool
- `ListTools` filtering in `src/server/server.ts` — users only see tools they have scopes for
- XSUAA role collections (ARC-1 Viewer/Editor/Admin) map to scopes via `xs-security.json`
- Additive to safety system — both scope check AND safety check must pass
- Backward compatible — no authInfo (stdio, simple API key) = no scope enforcement
- 12 unit tests covering all scope enforcement scenarios

**How it works:**
- `read` scope → SAPRead, SAPSearch, SAPQuery, SAPNavigate, SAPContext, SAPLint, SAPDiagnose (7 tools)
- `write` scope → adds SAPWrite, SAPActivate, SAPManage (10 tools)
- `admin` scope → adds SAPTransport (11 tools)
- XSUAA role collections assign scopes to users via BTP cockpit

**Why this matters for basis admins:**
- An SAP developer user (with full S_DEVELOP in Eclipse) can be restricted to read-only via AI
- The admin controls AI capabilities separately from SAP authorization
- **This is unique to ARC-1** — no other MCP server offers scope-based tool filtering

### SEC-07: XSUAA OAuth Proxy for MCP-Native Clients (Claude, Cursor, MCP Inspector)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | L (1–2 weeks) |
| **Risk** | Medium — requires careful OAuth flow implementation |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — enables Claude Desktop, Cursor, MCP Inspector to connect via BTP XSUAA |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete (2026-03-27) |

**Implemented:**
- MCP SDK's `ProxyOAuthServerProvider` proxies OAuth flow to XSUAA
- `@sap/xssec` v4.13+ for SAP-specific JWT validation (offline, JWKS cached)
- HTTP server refactored from `node:http` to Express 5 (required by MCP SDK auth)
- RFC 8414 discovery at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- In-memory client store for dynamic client registration (RFC 7591)
- Chained token verifier: XSUAA → Entra ID OIDC → API key (all coexist)
- `xs-security.json` with read/write/admin scopes and 3 role collections
- XSUAA service instance created and bound on BTP CF
- Configuration: `SAP_XSUAA_AUTH=true` enables the proxy

**Files:**
- `src/server/xsuaa.ts` — OAuth provider, client store, chained verifier
- `src/server/http.ts` — Express-based HTTP server with auth routing
- `xs-security.json` — XSUAA service instance config
- `docs/phase5-xsuaa-setup.md` — Setup guide

## 🔧 Features & Tools

### FEAT-01: Where-Used Analysis (Usage References)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — most requested missing feature |
| **Status** | Done |

**What:** Find all references to an ABAP object across the system. Uses ADT endpoint `/sap/bc/adt/repository/informationsystem/usageReferences`.

**Why:** Currently ARC-1 has `FindReferences` (code intelligence, position-based), but not the repository-wide "Where-Used" analysis that every ABAP developer uses daily.

**References:**
- [Report 001: Feature Parity](../reports/2026-03-24-001-feature-parity-implementation.md) — Item #1

---

### FEAT-02: API Release Status Tool (Clean Core)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Very High — critical for S/4HANA Cloud and clean core compliance |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Check whether an SAP object (class, function module, table, CDS view) is released, deprecated, or internal. Returns the API release state (C1 Released, C2 Deprecated, Not Released) and the recommended successor.

**Why:** Every S/4HANA Cloud / BTP ABAP customer needs to check if their code uses only released APIs. This is a "must have" for any AI copilot helping with ABAP Cloud development. The buettnerjulian/abap-adt-mcp competitor already has this.

---

### FEAT-03: Enhancement Framework (BAdI/Enhancement Spot)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3–5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — important for customization scenarios |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Read enhancement spots, BAdI definitions, and enhancement implementations. Uses ADT endpoints `/sap/bc/adt/enhancements/*`.

---

### FEAT-04: DDIC Object Support (Domains, Data Elements, DDLX)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | — |
| **Effort** | — |
| **Risk** | — |
| **Usefulness** | — |
| **Status** | ✅ Complete (2026-04-01) |

**Implemented:** Read support for domains (DOMA), data elements (DTEL), structures (STRU), CDS metadata extensions (DDLX), and transactions (TRAN) in SAPRead. Structured metadata output with type info, labels, value tables, search help. Write support for DDLS, DDLX, BDEF, SRVD via SAPWrite.

---

### FEAT-05: Code Refactoring (Rename, Extract Method)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟢 P3 |
| **Effort** | L (1–2 weeks) |
| **Risk** | Medium — complex ADT API interactions |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — valuable but complex |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** ADT supports code refactoring operations (rename symbol, extract method, change package). The marcellourbani/abap-adt-api TypeScript library implements these.

---

### FEAT-06: Cloud Readiness Assessment
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | M (3–5 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — unique differentiator for S/4HANA migration |
| **Status** | Not started |

**What:** Run ATC checks with ABAP Cloud check variant to assess whether code is cloud-ready. Combined with the enhanced abaplint integration (system-aware cloud/on-prem presets, pre-write validation, auto-fix), provide a comprehensive clean core compliance report.

**Why:** AWS ABAP Accelerator has this as a key feature. ARC-1 combines ATC cloud checks with `@abaplint/core` for offline linting.

**Current state (partially implemented):**
- ✅ System-aware abaplint presets (BTP cloud vs on-prem) with auto-detection from SAP_BASIS release
- ✅ Pre-write lint validation blocks cloud_types/strict_sql/obsolete_statement violations on BTP
- ✅ Auto-fix via `lint_and_fix` action (keyword_case, obsolete_statement, etc.)
- ✅ Custom rule overrides via `--abaplint-config` or per-call `rules` parameter
- ⬜ ATC Cloud check variant integration (server-side, complements offline abaplint)
- ⬜ Combined cloud readiness report (ATC + abaplint findings merged)

---

### FEAT-07: TLS/HTTPS for HTTP Streamable Transport
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🔴 P0 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — required for production enterprise deployments without reverse proxy |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [fr0ster tracker: TLS evaluation](../compare/fr0ster/evaluations/tls-https-support.md) |

**What:** Add native TLS support to the HTTP Streamable transport. fr0ster added this in v4.6.0 with `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` flags. Currently ARC-1 requires a reverse proxy (nginx, CF router) for HTTPS.

**Why:** Enterprise customers deploying outside BTP CF (e.g., on VMs, Kubernetes) need HTTPS without an external proxy. fr0ster's implementation shows the pattern: load cert/key files, create `https.Server` instead of `http.Server`.

**Implementation:**
- Add `SAP_TLS_CERT` / `SAP_TLS_KEY` env vars (and `--tls-cert` / `--tls-key` CLI flags)
- In `src/server/http.ts`, conditionally create `https.createServer()` when cert/key are provided
- Auto-detect port 443 vs 8080 based on TLS mode

---

### FEAT-08: Content-Type 415/406 Auto-Retry
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🔴 P0 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — robustness fix for SAP system variations |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [fr0ster tracker: 415 evaluation](../compare/fr0ster/evaluations/415-content-type-retry.md), [VSP tracker: issue #9](../compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/issue-9-transport-accept-header.md) |

**What:** SAP systems vary in Accept/Content-Type expectations across versions and endpoint types. When a request gets 415 (Unsupported Media Type) or 406 (Not Acceptable), automatically retry with alternative Content-Type headers.

**Why:** Both fr0ster (issue #22/#23) and VSP (issue #9) hit this on transport endpoints. It's a common SAP ADT compatibility issue across system versions. A transparent retry in `src/adt/http.ts` would handle it for all endpoints.

**Implementation:**
- In `src/adt/http.ts`, intercept 415/406 responses
- Retry with `Accept: application/xml` → `Accept: */*` (or vice versa)
- Retry with `Content-Type: application/xml` → `text/plain` for transport endpoints
- Max 1 retry, log the fallback

---

### FEAT-09: SQL Trace Monitoring
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — performance diagnostics |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [Feature matrix #17](../compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Read SQL trace state, list SQL traces, analyze trace results. Uses ADT endpoints `/sap/bc/adt/runtime/traces/sql/*`. VSP has `GetSQLTraceState`, `ListSQLTraces`.

**Why:** Completes the diagnostics story alongside short dumps and profiler traces. Useful for AI-assisted performance analysis.

---

### FEAT-10: PrettyPrint (Code Formatting)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — code formatting via ADT API |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [Feature matrix #14](../compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** Format ABAP source code via ADT's PrettyPrint API. VSP and mcp-abap-abap-adt-api have this. Also includes get/set PrettyPrinter settings.

---

### FEAT-11: Inactive Objects List
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟡 P2 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — development workflow improvement |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [Feature matrix #19](../compare/00-feature-matrix.md) |

**What:** List inactive objects system-wide. VSP and fr0ster both have this. Uses `/sap/bc/adt/activation/inactive`.

---

### FEAT-12: Fix Proposals / Auto-Fix from ATC
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — safer than LLM-guessed fixes |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [abap-adt-api eval](../compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/issue-37-quickfix.md) |

**What:** When ATC or syntax check finds an issue, SAP's fix proposal API (`/sap/bc/adt/quickfixes`) suggests the exact correction. Expose this via SAPDiagnose or SAPWrite so the LLM can apply verified fixes instead of guessing.

**Why:** Far safer than having the LLM guess the fix. Directly supports **safe defaults** and **token efficiency** — the LLM gets the exact fix without trial-and-error. The `abap-adt-api` library implements `fixProposals` and `fixEdits`.

---

### FEAT-13: DDIC Domain/Data Element Write
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — completes AI-assisted data modeling |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [abap-adt-api eval](../compare/abap-adt-api/evaluations/646bb9b-dtel-doma-write.md) |

**What:** ARC-1 reads DOMA/DTEL but can't write properties or fixed values. The `abap-adt-api` library (v7.1.1) added `createDomainDefinition`, `createDataElement`, and `createStructure` with full property support. Add write support for these in SAPWrite.

**Why:** Blocks full AI-assisted data modeling workflows. A developer asking the LLM to "create a domain ZSTATUS with values A=Active, I=Inactive" currently can't be fulfilled end-to-end.

---

### FEAT-14: 401 Session Timeout Auto-Retry
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🔴 P0 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — prevents mid-conversation failures |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](../compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/d73460a-401-auto-retry.md) |

**What:** After idle, SAP returns 401. ARC-1 handles CSRF 403 refresh but may not handle 401 session timeout. Add silent re-authentication and retry on 401 in `src/adt/http.ts`.

**Why:** Mid-conversation failures are disruptive to LLM workflows. VSP (#32) and `abap-adt-api` both handle this. A centralized gateway that stays idle between user requests will hit this frequently.

---

### FEAT-15: Namespace URL Encoding Audit
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — prevents hard-to-debug failures |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | [VSP eval](../compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/59b4b90-namespace-url-encoding.md), [VSP eval](../compare/vibing-steampunk/evaluations/6d1f00a-namespace-syntax-check.md) |

**What:** Namespaced objects (`/NAMESPACE/CLASS`) fail if `/` is not correctly encoded in ADT URLs. VSP hit this in issues #18, #52. Audit all `encodeURIComponent` usage in `src/adt/client.ts` and `src/adt/http.ts`.

---

### FEAT-16: Error Intelligence (Actionable Hints)
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — directly improves admin control and LLM UX |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern, Roadmap SEC-03 |

**What:** When SAP returns common errors (409 locked, 423 enqueued, 403 auth, 415 content type), return actionable hints: "Object locked by user X — check SM12", "Authorization failed — check SU53/PFCG", "Transport required — check SE09". Subsumes SEC-03 (S_DEVELOP awareness).

**Why:** Supports **centralized admin control** — admins and LLMs get clear guidance instead of raw SAP error HTML. Dassian does this well with its error intelligence pattern.

---

### FEAT-17: Type Auto-Mappings for SAPWrite
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | XS (< 1 day) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | Medium — reduces LLM confusion |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern |

**What:** Auto-map friendly type codes to ADT internal codes: `CLAS` → `CLAS/OC`, `INTF` → `INTF/OI`, `PROG` → `PROG/P`, etc. LLMs shouldn't need to know ADT's internal type code suffixes.

**Why:** Supports **token efficiency** — reduces failed create attempts where the LLM guesses the wrong type code.

---

### FEAT-18: Function Group Bulk Fetch
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟠 P1 |
| **Effort** | S (1–2 days) |
| **Risk** | Low |
| **Usefulness** | High — significant token/round-trip savings |
| **Status** | Not started |
| **Source** | Dassian pattern |

**What:** Fetch ALL includes and function modules of a function group in one call, instead of N sequential requests. Returns combined source with clear delimiters.

**Why:** Supports **token efficiency** — a function group with 20 FMs currently requires 20+ round trips. One bulk call reduces latency and simplifies the LLM's context.

33. **FEAT-30** ABAP Cleaner Integration (M) — optional Java-based code cleanup (see below)

### FEAT-30: ABAP Cleaner Integration (Future)

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | 🟢 P3 |
| **Effort** | M (3–5 days) |
| **Risk** | Medium — adds Java 21 dependency, ~200MB Docker image increase |
| **Usefulness** | High for teams already using ABAP cleaner profiles |
| **Status** | Research complete, not started |

**What:** Optional integration with SAP's [ABAP cleaner](https://github.com/SAP/abap-cleaner) CLI (`abap-cleanerc`) for 100+ code cleanup rules with 469 configuration options. Runs as a pre-stage before abaplint in the lint/fix pipeline. Teams can mount their `.cfj` profile files to enforce company coding standards.

**Why:** Many SAP teams already maintain ABAP cleaner profiles (`.cfj` files) as their shared coding standard. Integrating this means LLM-generated code automatically conforms to the team's existing rules — no new rule configuration needed. ABAP cleaner handles transformations abaplint can't: READ TABLE → table expressions, string concatenation → string templates, FINAL declarations, advanced alignment (21 DDL/CDS-specific rules).

**Architecture:** Three-stage pipeline: ABAP cleaner (Java CLI, transforms) → abaplint (TypeScript, lint+fix) → pre-write gate (TypeScript, block/pass). ABAP cleaner is optional — if Java/JAR not found, skipped silently. CLI invoked via `child_process.execFile` with `--source` for inline processing (<128KB) or temp files for larger sources. Output captured from stdout.

**Key details from research:**
- CLI: `abap-cleaner --source "<ABAP>" --release "757" --profile "team.cfj"` → cleaned source on stdout
- No stdin support — must use `--source` flag or `--sourcefile` with temp file
- No reliable exit codes (always 0) — error detection via stderr content
- Profile format: `.cfj` (JSON-like key-value with version header), `--profiledata` accepts inline content
- Release flag (`--release "757"`) maps to our existing `cachedFeatures.abapRelease`
- Docker: requires Java 21 + Eclipse RCP app (~200MB total). Suggest two image variants: `latest` (lean) and `with-cleaner` (full)
- Reference implementation: `vscode_abap_remote_fs/abapCleanerService.ts` wraps CLI with temp files + 30s timeout

**Config options (planned):**
- `SAP_ABAP_CLEANER_PATH` / `--abap-cleaner-path` — path to CLI binary
- `SAP_ABAP_CLEANER_PROFILE` / `--abap-cleaner-profile` — path to `.cfj` profile
- `SAP_ABAP_CLEANER_ENABLED` / `--abap-cleaner-enabled` — `auto` (default), `true`, `false`

### Phase E: Future / Niche (P3)
33. **FEAT-05** Code Refactoring (L) — rename, extract method, change package
34. **FEAT-29** P3 Backlog — see [FEAT-29 table](#feat-29-p3-backlog-future--niche) for SSE, debugger, execute ABAP, call graph, UI5/BSP, RFC, embeddable server, lock registry, language attributes

## Competitive Landscape

> **Detailed tracking**: See [`compare/`](../compare/) for per-commit and per-issue evaluations of key competitors.

| Competitor | Language | Tools | Auth | Safety | Deployment | Key Advantage |
|-----------|---------|-------|------|--------|------------|---------------|
| **ARC-1** | TypeScript | 11 intent-based + hyperfocused | API Key, OIDC, XSUAA, PP | Read-only, pkg filter, op filter, scope enforcement | Docker, BTP CF, npm | Per-user PP, scope-based tools, 3 auth modes, safety, 707+ tests |
| **vibing-steampunk** | Go 1.24 | 1-99 (3 modes) | Basic, Cookie | Op filter, pkg filter, transport guard | Go binary (9 platforms) | 242 stars, native ABAP parser, WASM compiler, Lua scripting |
| **fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt** | TypeScript | 287 (4 tiers) | 9 providers (incl. TLS, SAML, Device Flow) | Exposition tiers | npm `@mcp-abap-adt/core` | Most tools, most auth options, embeddable, RFC, multi-system |
| SAP ABAP Add-on MCP | ABAP | ~10 | SAP native | SAP authorization | Runs inside SAP | No proxy needed, SAP-native auth |
| lemaiwo/btp-sap-odata-to-mcp-server | TypeScript | ~10 | XSUAA OAuth proxy | XSUAA roles | BTP CF (MTA) | XSUAA OAuth proxy, principal propagation |
| dassian-adt / abap-mcpb | JavaScript | 25 | Basic, Browser login | MCP elicitation | Node.js / MCPB | Error intelligence, type auto-mappings, 7 elicitation flows |
| AWS ABAP Accelerator | Python | ~15 | OAuth, X.509 | Basic | AWS Lambda | Cloud readiness assessment, migration |

**ARC-1 differentiators (no other project has all of these):**
1. **Intent-based routing** — 11 tools vs 25-287, simplest LLM decision surface
2. **Principal propagation** — per-user SAP authentication via BTP Destination Service + Cloud Connector
3. **Scope-based tool filtering** — users only see tools they have permission for (read/write/admin via XSUAA roles)
4. **Three auth modes coexist** — XSUAA OAuth + Entra ID OIDC + API key on the same endpoint
5. **Comprehensive safety system** — read-only, package filter, operation filter, transport guard, dry-run — additive to scopes
6. **Multi-sink audit logging** — stderr + file + BTP Audit Log Service
7. **Context compression + method-level surgery** — AST-based 7-30x + 95% method-level reduction
8. **MCP elicitation** — interactive confirmations for destructive operations
9. **707+ automated tests** with CI on Node 20/22, BTP integration tests
10. **npm + Docker + release-please** — most professional distribution pipeline

**Key competitive threats** (tracked in [`compare/`](../compare/)):
1. **vibing-steampunk** (242 stars) — community favorite, daily commits, expanding into compilers/scripting. Lacks enterprise auth but developer-loved.
2. **fr0ster** (v4.8.1, 85+ releases in 5 months) — fastest-moving competitor. 9 auth providers, TLS, RFC, embeddable. Watch for convergence on enterprise features.
3. **btp-odata-mcp** (119 stars) — different category (OData) but high adoption. Could expand into ADT territory.
