## Project Overview

A multi-package monorepo MCP server for SAP ADT with 303 tools organized across 4 exposition tiers (read-only 55, high-level 127, low-level 122, compact 22). v5.0.0 added unified ADT feed tools (SM02 messages, gateway errors, feed reader) and migrated to adt-clients 4.0 factory API. v5.0.7-5.0.8 added 14 activation tools (1 group + 1 low-level + 12 per-type). Features the most comprehensive authentication system of any project (9 providers including SAML, OIDC device flow, token exchange). Strict interface isolation via separate npm packages.

Key differentiator: "AI Pairing, Not Vibing (AIPNV)" philosophy — positioned as pair programming assistant, not autopilot.

## Architecture

Multi-package ecosystem with 7+ npm packages under `@mcp-abap-adt` scope:

| Package | Purpose | NPM Monthly |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `@mcp-abap-adt/core` | Main MCP server, composition root | 3,625 |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/adt-clients` | Builder-first ABAP object CRUD (449 commits in own repo) | 5,074 |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker` | Token orchestration (cache → refresh → browser flow) | 1,051 |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/connection` | HTTP transport (CSRF, cookies, sessions) | — |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/logger` | Pino-based structured logging | — |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/configurator` | Auto-config for 11 MCP clients (`mcp-conf` CLI) | — |
| `@mcp-abap-adt/sap-rfc-lite` | Lightweight RFC (replaces archived node-rfc, v4.7.0) | — |

Design principles: Interface-Only Communication (IOC), Dependency Inversion, single composition root.

### Companion Repos
- **fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt-clients** — 449 commits, ADT client library with batch operations, lock registry, WebSocket facade
- **fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt-auth-broker** — JWT authentication broker for multi-destination token management

## Tool Inventory (303 tools across 4 tiers)

### Read-Only Tier (52 tools)

### High-Level Tier (127 tools)
Full CRUD with automatic lock/activate for 16+ object types: Classes (including local definitions, types, macros, test classes), Programs, Interfaces, Domains, Data Elements, Structures, Tables, Views (CDS), Function Groups/Modules, Service Definitions/Bindings, Behavior Definitions/Implementations, Metadata Extensions (DDLX), Packages, Transports, Unit Tests (ABAP + CDS). v5.0.7: Added ActivateObjects (group activation) + 12 per-type Activate handlers (ActivateDomain, ActivateClass, etc.)

### Low-Level Tier (122 tools)
Fine-grained per-operation-per-object: Lock/Unlock/Check/Activate/Validate/Create/Update/Delete + generic variants

### Compact Tier (22 tools)
Unified by `object_type` parameter: HandlerCreate, HandlerGet, HandlerUpdate, HandlerDelete, HandlerActivate, HandlerLock, HandlerUnlock, HandlerValidate, HandlerCheckRun, HandlerTransportCreate, HandlerUnitTestRun/Status/Result, HandlerCdsUnitTestStatus/Result, HandlerDumpList/View, HandlerProfileList/Run/View, HandlerServiceBindingListTypes/Validate

## Authentication (9 Providers — Most Advanced)

| Provider | Flow |
|----------|------|
| AuthorizationCodeProvider | Browser-based BTP OAuth2 |
| ClientCredentialsProvider | Machine-to-machine |
| DeviceFlowProvider | Devices without browsers |
| OidcBrowserProvider | Generic OIDC browser flow |
| OidcDeviceFlowProvider | OIDC device flow |
| OidcPasswordProvider | OIDC resource owner password |
| OidcTokenExchangeProvider | OIDC token exchange |
| Saml2BearerProvider | SAML2 bearer assertion |
| Saml2PureProvider | Pure SAML2 flow |

### Header-Based Auth Priority
| Priority | Method | Headers |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 4 (highest) | SAP Destination | `x-sap-destination` |
| 3 | MCP Destination + JWT | `x-mcp-destination` + `x-sap-auth-type=jwt` |
| 2 | Direct JWT | `x-sap-jwt-token` |
| 1 | Basic Auth | `x-sap-login` + `x-sap-password` |

### Token Lifecycle
AuthBroker: cache → refresh_token → browser OAuth2 → typed error. Automatic 401/403 retry.

## Safety/Security

- **Exposition control**: Limit active tool tiers (read-only, high-level, low-level, compact)
- **try-finally unlock**: Fixed in v4.5.0 — prevents lock leaks
- **Sensitive data redaction** in logs (Pino)
- **Session isolation**: HTTP/SSE = fresh connections per-request
- **`--unsafe` flag**: Controls file-based vs in-memory session persistence
- **SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE**: On-premise vs cloud tool availability
- **Lock registry**: Persistent `.locks/active-locks.json` with CLI recovery tools
- **No read-only flag or op filtering** like ARC-1 — relies on exposition control only

## Transport (MCP Protocol)

| Transport | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| stdio | Yes (default) |
| HTTP Streamable | Yes (`--http-port`) |
| SSE | Yes (`--sse-port`) |
| TLS/HTTPS | Yes (v4.6.0: `--tls-cert`, `--tls-key`, `--tls-ca`) |

## Configuration

- CLI args, environment variables, YAML config files
- `--mcp=<destination>`: service key selection
- `--auth-broker`: force auth-broker usage
- `--connection-type`: http or rfc
- Health endpoint: `GET /mcp/health` (v4.3.0)
- Configurator: `mcp-conf --client cline --name abap --mcp TRIAL`

## Testing

- Jest (unit + integration)
- Integration tests by handler tier and object type
- YAML test config (`test-config.yaml`)
- Global setup/teardown for lifecycle
- Test helpers: HighTester, LowTester, LambdaTester
- Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hooks (v4.5.2)

## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Relevant to ARC-1? |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| #22 | Lock leak — try-catch instead of try-finally for unlock | **Resolved** — ARC-1 already uses try-finally |
| #22, #23, #25 | 415 Content-Type errors — SAP needs specific Accept/Content-Type | **Resolved** — ARC-1 already has 406/415 auto-retry in http.ts ([evaluation](fr0ster/evaluations/415-content-type-retry.md), [deep dive](fr0ster/evaluations/v4.5.0-release-deep-dive.md)) |
| #24 | SAP_JWT_TOKEN overrides SAP_AUTH_TYPE | **No action** — ARC-1 infers auth type from credentials, no priority conflict ([evaluation](fr0ster/evaluations/dce44ca-auth-type-priority.md)) |
| #7, #6 | 409 conflict details not propagated to LLM | **Verify** — check ARC-1 AdtApiError includes SAP error body ([evaluation](fr0ster/evaluations/issue-7-6-409-error-details.md)) |
| #13 | Check runs fail with non-EN languages | **Verify** — check ARC-1 syntax check/ATC parsing uses language-independent attributes ([evaluation](fr0ster/evaluations/issue-13-i18n-check-handling.md)) |
| #30 | Object history + transport contents | **Medium** — transport contents useful, object history lower priority ([evaluation](fr0ster/evaluations/issue-30-object-history-transport-contents.md)) |
| #31 | RuntimeRunClassWithProfiling stale trace ID | **Not applicable** — ARC-1 doesn't have execute-with-profiling |
| #33, #32 | Test infra: transport/lock conflicts | **Not relevant** — specific to their multi-system test setup |
| BTP Cloud | Data preview may not work | Yes — document BTP limitations |
