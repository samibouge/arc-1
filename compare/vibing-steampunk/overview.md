# oisee/vibing-steampunk — Commit & Issue Tracker

> Tracking commits and issues from [oisee/vibing-steampunk](https://github.com/oisee/vibing-steampunk) (ARC-1's upstream) for features and bug fixes worth adopting.

_Last updated: 2026-04-16_

## Approach

- **Commits**: Grouped by release in `commits.json`. Auto-triaged by commit prefix.
- **Issues**: All 55 issues evaluated in `issues.json`
- **Evaluations**: Detailed write-ups for high/medium priority items in `evaluations/`
- **Scope**: Tracking from v2.22.0 (2026-02-01) onwards
- **Key difference from fr0ster**: VSP is ARC-1's upstream — same safety system design, shared heritage. ~70% of commits are experimental (WASM/LLVM compilers, Lua, JS evaluator) and not relevant.

## Stats

| Metric | Commits | Issues |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Total | 517+ | 55 |
| Tracked | 117 | 55 |
| Evaluated | 109 | 55 |
| Pending evaluation | 0 | 0 |
| Skipped (not relevant) | 68 | 25 |
| Evaluation files | 34 | 9 |

## Priority Summary

### Low / Skip (no action needed)

- WASM/LLVM/JS compiler experiments (30+ commits) — experimental, not MCP tooling
- Lua scripting — Go-specific
- ABAP LSP — niche
- CLI governance tools (cr-config-audit, cr-audit) — not MCP tooling
- CLI mode — ARC-1 is MCP-only
- Debugger — requires ZADT_VSP deployment
- GetAbapHelp — requires ZADT_VSP WebSocket
- BTP Basic Auth issue (#90) — ARC-1 correctly uses OAuth
- SAProuter (#103) — ARC-1 uses Cloud Connector

## How to Update

Run `/update-competitor-tracker` from Claude Code (covers both fr0ster and vibing-steampunk).

## Relationship to Existing Analysis

This tracker **complements** [../01-vibing-steampunk.md](../01-vibing-steampunk.md) which has:
- High-level project comparison
- Feature gap analysis (what upstream has vs ARC-1)
- Changelog & Relevance Tracker (release-level)
