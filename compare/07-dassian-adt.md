## Project Overview

A rapidly maturing MCP server building on the `abap-adt-api` library (v7.1.2 by Marcello Urbani) with **53 tools**. Key differentiators: heavy use of **MCP elicitation** for interactive parameter collection, extensive **error intelligence** with self-correction hints, **OAuth 2.0 per-user SAP authentication**, **multi-system support** via SAP UI Landscape XML auto-discovery, and a unique `abap_run` tool for direct ABAP execution.

Backed by Dassian Inc. (commercial entity). MIT licensed. Includes Azure App Service deployment support and GitHub Pages documentation for all 53 tools. **Has gone from 0 stars to 32 stars in 2 weeks** — fastest-growing competitor.

## Architecture

```
src/
  server.ts          # MCP server setup (stdio + HTTP)
  handlers/
    BaseHandler.ts   # Input validation, session recovery, error formatting
    SourceHandlers   # get/set source, function group bulk, edit method, class includes
    ObjectHandlers   # CRUD, search, activation, batch activation
    RunHandlers      # ABAP execution via IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN
    TransportHandlers # CTS operations (create/assign/release/list/info/contents)
    DataHandlers     # SQL queries, table contents
    QualityHandlers  # Syntax check, ATC, where-used, fix proposals, unit tests
    GitHandlers      # gCTS repos, pull
    SystemHandlers   # login, health, dumps, raw HTTP, traces
    DiagnosticHandlers # Profiler traces, inactive objects
    DDICHandlers     # Domain, data element, annotation definitions
```

All handlers delegate to `abap-adt-api` v7.1.2.

## Authentication

| Method | Supported |
|--------|-----------|
| Basic Auth (stdio) | Yes — shared SAP_USER/SAP_PASSWORD |
| Per-user browser login (HTTP) | Yes — /login page, session-based |
| Shared service account (HTTP) | Yes — env var credentials |
| **MCP OAuth 2.0 per-user** | **Yes (Apr 14, 2026)** — per-user SAP authentication via OAuth |
| **XSUAA OAuth** | **Yes (Apr 12, 2026)** — service key or individual env vars |
| OIDC/JWT | **No** |
| BTP Destination Service | **No** |
| Principal Propagation | **No** |
| API Key | **No** |

**New (Apr 12-14):** OAuth/XSUAA support and MCP OAuth 2.0 per-user authentication. This is a significant enterprise maturity step. Still lacks BTP Destination Service and Principal Propagation.

## Multi-System Support (NEW — Apr 12, 2026)

Added SAP UI Landscape XML auto-discovery — can read `SAPUILandscapeGlobal.xml` to discover and connect to multiple SAP systems. This is unique among MCP servers and leverages SAP's own system landscape configuration.

## Safety/Security

**No safety system.** No read-only mode, no operation filtering, no package restrictions, no SQL blocking. All 53 tools always available including `raw_http` (arbitrary ADT HTTP calls).

**MCP elicitation** provides UX guardrails (confirmation for delete, transport release, ATC variant fallback, batch activation failure, method editing recovery) but no hard blocks.

**Error intelligence**: classifies SAP errors, provides actionable hints (SM12 for locks, SPAU for upgrades, session timeout detection with 400 error broadening).

## Transport (MCP Protocol)

| Transport | Supported |
|-----------|-----------|
| stdio | Yes (default) |
| HTTP Streamable | Yes (configurable port/path) |
| SSE | **No** |

## Testing

163+ unit tests (Jest): URL builder, error classification, input validation. Integration test scaffold exists. AI self-test prompt in `scripts/ai-selftest.md`.

## Dependencies

@modelcontextprotocol/sdk ^1.28.0, abap-adt-api ^7.1.2, dotenv ^16.4.7
Dev: jest ^29.7.0, ts-jest ^29.2.5

## Azure & Cloud Deployment

- **Azure App Service**: PORT env var support (Apr 14, 2026)
- **GitHub Pages**: Human-readable HTML reference for all 53 tools (Apr 12, 2026)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Architecture documentation for AI assistants (Apr 9, 2026)

## Known Issues

| Issue | Description | Relevant to ARC-1? |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| No safety system | AI can do anything including raw HTTP | ARC-1's safety system is a major differentiator |
| No caching | Every request hits SAP | ARC-1 has SQLite + memory |
| No linting | No abaplint | ARC-1 has abaplint integration |
| No BTP Destination/PP | Has OAuth but not Destination Service or PP | ARC-1 has full BTP support |
| Lock management fragile | Multiple lock-related bug fixes (session-sticky, dead locks, retry cycles) | ARC-1's withStatefulSession() is more robust |
| Transport task/request confusion | Many fixes for CORRNR vs request number, task classification | Verify ARC-1 transport.ts handles correctly |
| abap-adt-api workarounds | Several bypass the library | Validate ARC-1's custom HTTP handles edge cases |
| raw_http | Unrestricted ADT HTTP | Potential security concern |

## abap-mcpb (MCPB Variant — March 31, 2026)

albanleong/abap-mcpb packages dassian-adt as an **MCPB** (MCP Bundle) for Claude Desktop. Key differences:
- **Zero build step** — MCPB format with form-based configuration
- **Per-tool permissions** — Claude Desktop's native authorization UI
- May lag behind dassian-adt's rapid development (53 tools vs MCPB's snapshot)
- 2 files customized: QualityHandlers.js (enhanced ATC), index.js (error handling)

## Strategic Assessment (Updated 2026-04-14)

**Dassian-adt has undergone a dramatic transformation** from an early-stage 25-tool prototype to a 53-tool enterprise-grade MCP server in just 2 weeks. Key competitive developments:

1. **OAuth/XSUAA** — Closed the most critical auth gap. Still lacks BTP Destination Service + Principal Propagation.
2. **Multi-system** — SAP UI Landscape XML is unique and pragmatic for on-premise environments.
3. **53 tools** — Feature surface doubled. Now has fix proposals, unit tests, traces, revisions, inactive objects — capabilities ARC-1 also has or plans.
4. **32 stars in 2 weeks** — Fastest community adoption among competitors.
5. **Azure focus** — App Service compatibility suggests Azure-first enterprise positioning.

**ARC-1 still leads in:** Safety system, BTP-native deployment, token efficiency (11 vs 53 tools), context compression, caching, audit logging, CI/testing maturity (1315 tests), MCP scope system, professional distribution (npm/Docker/release-please).

**Risk:** If Dassian adds safety controls and BTP support, the gap narrows significantly. Monitor closely.
