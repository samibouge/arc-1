# SAP ABAP MCP Server & ADT for VS Code — Strategic Analysis

> **Products**: ABAP Cloud Extension for VS Code + ABAP MCP Server + ABAP Language Server
> **Vendor**: SAP SE
> **Status**: Pre-GA — announced TechEd 2025, GA planned Q2 2026 (April–June 2026)
> **Impact**: High — this is SAP's official entry into the MCP/agentic ABAP development space
> **Last updated**: 2026-04-04

## Executive Summary

SAP is shipping three interconnected components in Q2 2026, **all targeting VS Code** (not Eclipse — J4D for Eclipse is a separate product, see [01-joule-for-developers.md](01-joule-for-developers.md)):

1. **ABAP Cloud Extension for VS Code** — a first-party VS Code extension with IDE capabilities for ABAP development
2. **ABAP Language Server** — an LSP server wrapping 2.9M lines of Eclipse ADT client logic, repackaged for VS Code
3. **ABAP MCP Server** — an MCP server exposing ABAP development capabilities to AI agents

**Key differences from J4D (Eclipse):**
- The **VS Code extension (non-AI development tooling)** reuses the same Eclipse ADT client code with compatibility back to **NW 7.3 EHP1 SP04**. SAP has explicitly confirmed: *"We plan to support all releases down to SAP NetWeaver 7.3 EHP1 SP04"* and *"users can connect to any ABAP server release supported by Eclipse through the VS Code extension."*
- However, the focus is **ABAP Cloud development model only** — no Dynpro, Web Dynpro, classic programming models.
- The **ABAP MCP Server** exposes capabilities *"both with and without embedded AI"*. AI capabilities require BTP/AI Core. Whether non-AI MCP tools work on older systems is not explicitly stated.
- The **ABAP MCP Server starts in VS Code, with Eclipse to follow** — SAP's roadmap says *"The initial scope focuses on VS Code for ABAP, with ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse to follow."*

**Unresolved tension in SAP's messaging:** NW 7.3 systems don't support the ABAP Cloud development model (which requires at minimum S/4HANA 2020 or BTP ABAP). The NW 7.3 compatibility likely covers basic operations (reading code, navigating, editing classes) but not Cloud-model-specific workflows (RAP, clean core).

This represents both a **competitive threat** (SAP's official MCP server competes directly with ARC-1) and a **strategic opportunity** (the broader development tooling support could benefit the ecosystem).

## Architecture Deep-Dive

### How SAP Built ADT for VS Code

SAP faced a massive challenge: their Eclipse ADT plugin contains **2.9 million lines of Java client code** built over 16 years. Rather than rewriting, they adopted the same approach as the **Java VS Code extension (JDT LS)**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    VS Code                               │
│  ┌──────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐ │
│  │ ABAP Cloud   │  │   Joule     │  │  AI Agents     │ │

│  └──────┬───────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └───────┬────────┘ │
│         │                  │                  │          │
│         │ LSP              │ Internal         │ MCP      │
│         ▼                  ▼                  ▼          │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │           ABAP Language Server (Java)                ││
│  │  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐   ││
│  │  │  Wrapped Eclipse ADT Client Code (2.9M LOC)  │   ││
│  │  │  - ADT REST API wrappers                     │   ││
│  │  │  - Debugger, ATC, test runner logic          │   ││
│  │  │  - Compatibility: NW 7.3 EHP1 SP04+          │   ││
│  │  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘   ││
│  └─────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘│
└────────────────────────┼────────────────────────────────┘
                         │ ADT REST APIs (/sap/bc/adt/*)
                         ▼
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │   SAP ABAP Backend   │
              │  (BTP / S/4HANA)     │
              └──────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight**: The Language Server is NOT a thin REST wrapper. It embeds the full Eclipse ADT client — all the complex logic for editor behaviors, debugging, ATC, refactoring, etc. that has been built over 16 years. However, it still communicates with the ABAP backend via the **same `/sap/bc/adt/` REST APIs** that ARC-1 uses.

### Server-Driven Development Framework

Since 2020, SAP has been building new ADT object type editors using a "server-driven development" pattern:
- The **ABAP backend sends UI model definitions** (similar to Fiori Elements / Dynpro)
- The client only needs **two renderer types**: form-based editors and source-based editors
- This means new object types can be added without client-side development
- This pattern is what makes the VS Code port feasible — the same renderers work in both Eclipse and VS Code

### Virtual Workspace

- ABAP development objects remain **stored on the ABAP server** (no local files by default)
- VS Code uses **virtual workspace technology** to present them as local files
- SAP plans to offer **local sync** for git integration without abapGit
- **Critical limitation**: Not all AI coding assistants support virtual workspaces — may limit compatibility with Copilot, Cursor, etc.

### ABAP File Formats

- SAP has an open-source specification: [github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats)
- Defines how ABAP objects are represented as files (for serialization/deserialization)
- Used by the VS Code extension for local sync
- Could be useful for ARC-1 if we want to support file-based workflows

---

## System Compatibility — What SAP Has Actually Said

This is the most important section for competitive analysis. SAP's messaging has layers that must be separated:

### VS Code Extension (Development Tooling — Non-AI)

| SAP Statement | Source |
|---------------|--------|
| *"We plan to support all releases down to SAP NetWeaver 7.3 EHP1 SP04"* | [Everything You Need to Know](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-development-tools-for-vs-code-everything-you-need-to-know/ba-p/14258129) |
| *"Users can connect to any ABAP server release supported by Eclipse through the VS Code extension"* | [Behind the Design](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/behind-the-design-how-we-transformed-the-abap-development-tools/ba-p/14258121) |
| *"Primary focus will be support for the ABAP Cloud Development Model"* | [Everything You Need to Know](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-development-tools-for-vs-code-everything-you-need-to-know/ba-p/14258129) |
| *"It is not planned to support classic programming models such as Dynpro or Web Dynpro"* | [Everything You Need to Know](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/abap-development-tools-for-vs-code-everything-you-need-to-know/ba-p/14258129) |
| *"Eclipse for ABAP will remain our flagship IDE for full-fledged ABAP development"* | [Introducing the Next Era](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-next-era-of-abap-development/ba-p/14260522) |

**Interpretation:** You CAN connect VS Code to an ECC 7.4 or on-prem S/4HANA system for basic operations (code reading, navigation, editing). But the ABAP Cloud development model features (RAP workflows, clean core) won't be available on systems that don't support it (pre-S/4HANA 2020). Classic programming models (Dynpro, Web Dynpro) are explicitly excluded.

### AI Capabilities (Joule / J4D)

| System | J4D Availability |
|--------|-----------------|
| BTP ABAP Environment | ✅ Available |
| S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition | ✅ Available |
| S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2025 (RISE) | ✅ Available |
| S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition 2021–2023 (RISE) | ⏳ Planned Q2 2026 |
| S/4HANA on-premise (non-RISE) | ❌ Not available / not on roadmap |
| ECC / NetWeaver 7.x | ❌ Not available |

**Note:** The ABAP AI SDK (for calling LLMs from ABAP code) is available for S/4HANA on-premise 2025 (standard delivery) and 2021+ (via SAP Note 3513374 TCI). But this is the runtime SDK, not J4D IDE features.

### ABAP MCP Server

SAP has stated it exposes capabilities *"both with and without embedded AI"* but has **never explicitly mapped** which capabilities work on which system types. The key unknown: do the non-AI MCP tools (code read/write, ATC, syntax check) work independently on older systems, while AI tools require BTP/AI Core?

**ARC-1's advantage here is clarity**: ARC-1 works on any system with ADT REST APIs enabled, period. No ambiguity.

---

## SAP's Two-Pillar AI Strategy

SAP organizes ABAP GenAI use cases into two pillars (from internal presentation):

**Pillar 1: Developer Efficiency** (target: developers)
- Joule Chat
- Intelligent Code Completion
- Code Explanation (ABAP, CDS, Report)
- Unit Test + ABAP Cloud App Generation
- ABAP AI SDK with ISLM (calling LLMs from ABAP runtime — separate scope)

**Pillar 2: Custom Code Migration** (target: developers + project managers)
- Joule Chat
- Documentation Chat
- Legacy Code + ATC Finding Explanation
- Code Proposals (for adaptations)
- Custom Code Migration App Integration

This segmentation is important: **Pillar 2 targets project managers** too, not just developers. ARC-1 currently focuses exclusively on developer workflows. Enterprise Custom Code Migration is a high-value area where ARC-1 could expand (via `SAPDiagnose(atc)` + readiness check variants + `mcp-sap-docs` simplification notes).

---

## The ABAP MCP Server

### What SAP Has Said

From the blog post ["Introducing the Next Era of ABAP Development"](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/introducing-the-next-era-of-abap-development/ba-p/14260522):

> "A new ABAP MCP server will expose ABAP development capabilities, both with and without embedded AI, to agents."

From ["2025 set the pace, 2026 wins the race"](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blog-posts-by-sap/2025-set-the-pace-2026-wins-the-race-abap-ai-with-joule-vs-code-and-ccm/ba-p/14302433):

> The VS Code extension will include "ABAP language server, ABAP MCP server, native Joule for Developers"

From the 2026 roadmap:

> "The transition from independent AI skills to full-scale Agentic AI"

### What We Can Infer

Based on the architecture and statements, SAP's ABAP MCP Server will likely:

1. **Expose existing Joule AI skills as MCP tools:**
   - Code explanation
   - Unit test generation (with all sub-features: dep analysis, test doubles, splitting, refactoring)
   - CDS test generation
   - OData consume code generation
   - RAP business logic prediction
   - RAP service generation (OData UI Service from Scratch)

2. **Expose non-AI development capabilities as MCP tools:**
   - Code read/write/activate
   - ATC checks
   - Syntax checks
   - Unit test execution
   - Debugging (possibly)
   - Transport operations (possibly)

3. **Run alongside the Language Server** — leveraging the same ADT client code

4. **Support third-party AI agents** — SAP explicitly mentions Claude/Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Amazon, IBM, Mistral as supported LLM providers

### What We Don't Know

- **Exact MCP tool definitions** — tool names, parameters, descriptions
- **Whether it requires the Language Server** — can it run standalone?
- **Transport protocol** — stdio only? HTTP Streamable?
- **Authentication model** — reuse VS Code extension auth? API keys?
- **System scope for non-AI MCP tools** — SAP confirmed NW 7.3+ support for the VS Code extension, and the MCP server exposes capabilities "with and without AI." But SAP has never explicitly stated: "the non-AI MCP tools work on NW 7.3." This is the biggest open question.
- **System scope for AI MCP tools** — AI capabilities require BTP + AI Core. Currently: BTP ABAP, S/4HANA Cloud Public, S/4HANA PCE 2025. Planned Q2 2026: PCE 2021–2023. Pure on-premise (non-RISE): unclear.
- **Open source or proprietary** — likely proprietary, distributed as part of extension
- **Whether it exposes raw ADT capabilities** — or only AI-enhanced ones

---

## The ADT Language Server — Can ARC-1 Benefit?

### What It Is

The ABAP Language Server wraps the existing Eclipse ADT Java client code with an LSP interface. It provides:

- Code completion (context-aware, based on 16 years of ABAP-specific logic)
- Diagnostics (syntax checking, ATC findings)
- Navigation (go-to-definition, find references)
- Refactoring (rename, extract — the full Eclipse ADT refactoring engine)
- Debugging support
- Form-based and source-based editors

### Can ARC-1 Use It?

**Short answer: Probably not directly, but the underlying APIs remain accessible.**

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is it open source? | **No** — proprietary, distributed as VSIX extension |
| Can we call it as an LSP server? | Theoretically, but it's Java-based and likely tightly coupled to the VS Code extension |
| Does it expose new server-side APIs? | **No** — it wraps the same `/sap/bc/adt/` REST APIs that ARC-1 already uses |
| Does it add new backend components? | **No** — the ABAP backend does not change; it's all client-side wrapping |
| Is the LSP protocol accessible from outside VS Code? | Unlikely — LSP is typically a stdio pipe between editor and server process |

**Bottom line: The Language Server adds no new capabilities that ARC-1 cannot access via ADT REST APIs.** The value is in the 2.9M lines of client logic (editor behaviors, refactoring safety checks, etc.) — but this logic makes the *IDE experience* better, not the *API surface* richer.

However, there is one area of potential benefit:

### ABAP File Formats (Open Source)

The [ABAP file formats](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats) specification IS open source. This could benefit ARC-1 by:
- Providing a standard way to serialize/deserialize ABAP objects as files
- Enabling file-based workflows (export → edit locally → push back)
- Potential integration with git-based workflows

---

## Competitive Threat Assessment

### Where SAP's Solution Will Be Superior

| Capability | Why SAP Wins |
|-----------|-------------|
| **IDE integration depth** | 2.9M LOC of editor behaviors, form-based editors, server-driven UI — impossible to replicate via MCP |
| **Refactoring safety** | Full cross-object rename/extract with dependency checks built into Language Server |
| **Debugging** | Integrated debugger — MCP can't provide step-through debugging |
| **Code completion quality** | 16 years of ABAP-specific completion logic (not just LLM ghost text) |
| **AI + tooling integration** | Joule skills can invoke ADT operations atomically (e.g., generate test → write → activate → run in one flow) |
| **Official support** | SAP-maintained, versioned, documented, with support tickets |
| **Backend-side AI** | SAP AI Core integration — server-side AI capabilities not accessible to external tools |
| **Extensibility framework** | Deep integration with ABAP Cloud extensibility APIs |

### Where SAP's Solution Will Be Weaker

| Limitation | Why ARC-1 Wins |
|-----------|----------------|
| **No classic programming models** | Explicitly excluded: Dynpro, Web Dynpro, reports, transactions. Focus is ABAP Cloud model only |
| **AI features: cloud/RISE only** | AI capabilities (Joule skills) confirmed only for BTP ABAP, Public Cloud, RISE. Non-AI MCP tools on older systems: unclear |
| **On-premise ambiguity** | VS Code dev tooling works on NW 7.3+, but whether MCP server tools are available on non-cloud systems is unanswered |
| **~12 object types at launch** | ARC-1 covers all ADT-accessible object types today |
| **Eclipse parity will take years** | SAP says it took 16 years to build Eclipse ADT — VS Code will be incomplete for a long time |
| **Virtual workspace issues** | Not all AI tools support virtual workspaces — may break Copilot, Cursor, other AI assistants |
| **LLM routing via SAP GenAI Hub** | Must go through SAP infrastructure; no direct API key usage for LLM providers |
| **Licensed** | Separate paid license required (SAP Note 3571857) |
| **VS Code only** | VSIX may work in Cursor/Theia but not guaranteed; no Claude Desktop, no CLI, no JetBrains |
| **No transport management** | J4D focuses on development, not DevOps (no transport create/release/assign) |
| **No SQL execution** | No `RunQuery` equivalent |
| **No runtime diagnostics** | No ST22 dump analysis, no profiler traces |
| **No safety controls** | No read-only mode, op filtering, package restrictions for MCP exposure |
| **Heavyweight** | Java Language Server process + VS Code = significant resource overhead |

```

**Key insight**: The ABAP MCP Server sits between J4D and ARC-1 in terms of system support. Its development tooling (via the Language Server) is confirmed for NW 7.3+, but whether its AI capabilities or even non-AI MCP tools actually work on older systems is SAP's biggest unanswered question. ARC-1's advantage is clarity: it works on any system with ADT, no ambiguity, no cloud dependency.

---

## Strategic Opportunities

### 1. Coexistence Strategy

SAP's MCP server and ARC-1 can coexist. J4D (Eclipse) is clearly segmented (RISE/Public Cloud only), but the ABAP MCP Server (VS Code) may have broader reach since it uses the same ADT APIs that work on older systems. The competitive overlap depends on whether SAP restricts the MCP server to cloud systems or opens it up.

**Action:** Position ARC-1 as the **enterprise-grade, universal SAP MCP server** vs SAP's **cloud-first, IDE-embedded** approach.

### 2. Complementary Usage

Users may run BOTH:
- SAP's MCP server for Joule-powered AI skills (SAP AI Core integration)
- ARC-1 for operations SAP doesn't expose (transport mgmt, SQL, diagnostics, safety controls)

**Action:** Ensure ARC-1 tools don't conflict with SAP's MCP tool names. Test side-by-side usage.

### 3. ABAP File Formats Integration

The open-source [abap-file-formats](https://github.com/SAP/abap-file-formats) spec could enable:
- File-based export/import workflows in ARC-1
- Local git integration without abapGit
- Better integration with AI coding tools that expect local files

**Action:** Investigate abap-file-formats for potential ARC-1 integration.

### 4. Virtual Workspace Limitation Exploitation

SAP's virtual workspace may break compatibility with AI coding assistants. ARC-1 works with standard file systems.

**Action:** Test and document AI tool compatibility comparisons (ARC-1 works everywhere; SAP's may not).

### 5. Speed-to-Market

ARC-1 is available NOW. SAP's solution is Q2 2026 at earliest and will be feature-incomplete for years.

**Action:** Capture adoption before SAP ships. Establish skills library and community.
