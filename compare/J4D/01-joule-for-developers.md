## Product Overview

Joule for Developers is SAP's native AI copilot for ABAP development. It is embedded in **ABAP Development Tools for Eclipse** (ADT) and provides slash-command-driven AI assistance for common development tasks.

**Important**: J4D is an **Eclipse-only** feature. The upcoming ABAP MCP Server (see [02-sap-abap-mcp-server-vscode.md](02-sap-abap-mcp-server-vscode.md)) is the separate VS Code counterpart.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Eclipse ADT only** — not available in VS Code, BAS, or other editors
- **Closed source** — no API, no self-hosting, no customization of underlying models
- **RISE / Public Cloud only** — available only for SAP BTP ABAP Environment, S/4HANA Cloud Public Edition, and S/4HANA Cloud Private Edition (RISE). **Not available for on-premise ECC or S/4HANA on-premise.**
- **Licensed separately** — requires additional license (SAP Note 3571857)
- **Cloud-tenant-bound** — requires BTP subscription + SAP AI Core (GenAI Hub)

**Authorization requirements:**
- Business role with catalog `SAP_A4C_BC_DEV_AIQ_PC`
- Authorization object `S_AIQADTLO` with values `AIQ_TYPE = [JADC_CODE, JADC_TEXT]` and `ACTVT = AF`
- Certificate-based connection via `APPLDESTCC` transaction (for S/4HANA PCE)

ARC-1 + skills aims to replicate and exceed J4D's capabilities using open MCP tools, any LLM, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Detailed Feature Breakdown

### 1. Joule Chat (Default)

**What it does:**
- AI pair programmer for general ABAP development questions
- IDE context-aware — considers all open editors/views
- Supports follow-up conversations with chat history
- Auto-dispatches to `/explain` or `/aunit` when appropriate
- Can generate code snippets with Insert/Copy/Apply buttons

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:** Any MCP client chat naturally provides this. The LLM (Claude, etc.) serves as the pair programmer. `SAPRead` + `SAPContext` + `mcp-sap-docs` provide the context.

**Coverage: ✅ Fully covered** — inherent to using an LLM with ARC-1 MCP tools.

### 2. Explain (`/explain`)

**What it does:**
- Explains ABAP classes, programs, CDS artifacts
- Explains ATC findings (simplification items only)
- IDE context-aware (considers all open resources)
- Quick replies for "more detailed" / "more understandable" explanations
- Shows "Used objects" that influenced the answer
- In-app Code Explain and ATC Explain in Custom Code Migration app

**Supported object types:** ABAP classes, ABAP programs, ATC findings (simplification items), CDS artifacts

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPRead` — fetch source code for any object type
- `SAPContext` — full dependency graph + public contracts (richer than J4D's IDE context)
- `SAPDiagnose(atc)` — get ATC findings
- `mcp-sap-docs` — look up SAP documentation for unfamiliar APIs/patterns
- Skill needed: `explain-abap-code`

**Coverage: ✅ Fully achievable** — skill needed. ARC-1 provides richer context via `SAPContext`.

### 3. ABAP Unit Test Generation (`/aunit`)

**What it does — this is J4D's most feature-rich capability:**

| Sub-feature | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Test Generation** | Generate tests for public/protected/private methods of global classes, public methods of local classes |
| **Method Selection** | Dialog with coverage metrics, usage counts, implementation toggle |
| **Most-Used Methods** | Auto-select most-used methods for test generation |
| **Local Class Testing** | Generate tests for local classes within class pools |
| **Dependency Analysis** | AI-based identification of test-unfriendly dependencies (DB, APIs, etc.) |
| **Test Double Support** | Generate test doubles for: interfaces, function modules, database tables, CDS views |
| **Test Code Explanations** | Explain test scope, identify test smells, describe test patterns |
| **Generated Test Code Refactoring** | Predefined instructions: avoid Hungarian notation, create CUT in setup, extract custom assertions, use inline declarations, use constructor expressions, program against interfaces |
| **Splitting Test Classes** | Split test class into 2 test classes + 1 abstract base class |
| **Splitting Test Methods** | Split large/multi-assertion test methods into focused ones |
| **Freestyle Prompts** | Free-text prompts within `/aunit` context |

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPRead` — fetch class source, test class source
- `SAPContext` — dependency extraction (already does AST-based dep analysis)
- `SAPWrite(update)` / `SAPWrite(edit_method)` — write test code back
- `SAPDiagnose(unittest)` — run tests and get results
- `SAPActivate` — activate test class
- Skill needed: `generate-abap-unit-test` (comprehensive version)

**Coverage: ⚠️ Partially covered** — basic test generation works, but J4D's sub-features (dependency analysis, test double generation, splitting, refactoring instructions) are significantly more sophisticated. Multiple dedicated skills or a comprehensive skill needed.

**Gaps:**
- No structured dependency analysis with test-unfriendly dependency classification
- No automated test double scaffolding for interfaces/FMs/tables/CDS
- No test splitting workflow
- No predefined refactoring instruction set

### 4. CDS Unit Test Generation

**What it does:**
- Generates test classes for ABAP CDS entities using CDS Test Double Framework
- Wizard-driven: select CDS entity → see test case suggestions → select → generate
- AI generates test method names and test data

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- Existing `generate-cds-unit-test` skill
- `SAPRead(DDLS, ...)` — fetch CDS source
- `SAPWrite` + `SAPActivate` — write and activate test class

**Coverage: ✅ Fully covered** — skill already exists.

### 5. Consume (`/consume`)

**What it does:**
- Generates OData Client Proxy ABAP code from natural language prompts
- Input: natural language ("I want to read field ID from all campaigns") or raw HTTP request
- Output: OData request + ABAP code using OData Client Proxy
- Requires existing Service Consumption Model with model class

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPRead` — can read service consumption models and metadata
- `mcp-sap-docs` — OData Client Proxy documentation, RAP patterns
- LLM generates ABAP code for OData consumption
- Skill needed: `consume-odata-service`

**Coverage: ⚠️ Partially covered** — LLM can generate OData proxy code, but no dedicated skill yet. The Service Consumption Model reading may need ADT API investigation.

### 6. Documentation Chat (`/docs`)

**What it does:**
- Chat with SAP Help Portal documentation
- Covers: ABAP Keyword Documentation, RAP, ABAP Data Models, ABAP Cloud
- Considers project context and chat history
- Provides links to source documentation

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `mcp-sap-docs` — **this is exactly what mcp-sap-docs does**, and more broadly (not limited to 4 guides)
- `mcp-sap-docs` searches SAP Help Portal, community blog posts, and more

**Coverage: ✅ Fully covered** — `mcp-sap-docs` provides this and more. No skill needed — it's a direct MCP tool call.

### 7. Predictive Code Completion

**What it does:**
- Ghost text completion in ABAP source editor
- Based on StarCoder 2 fine-tuned on SAP ABAP code
- Supports: interfaces, classes, programs
- Accept: Tab (all), Ctrl+Down (next line), Ctrl+Right (next word)
- Toggled via toolbar or preferences

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- **Not applicable** — this is an IDE-native feature requiring real-time editor integration
- Would require VS Code extension + completion provider, not an MCP tool
- VS Code with Copilot/Cline/Continue already provides AI completion (but not ABAP-specific)

**Coverage: ❌ Not applicable** — out of scope for MCP server architecture. IDE extensions handle this.

### 8. OData UI Service from Scratch

**What it does:**
- Wizard creates complete RAP BO from natural language description
- Generates: service binding, service definition, access control, behavior definitions, CDS views (projection + base), metadata extensions, draft tables, persistent tables, behavior pool class
- Only managed BOs with UUID internal early numbering
- Supports: transactional with/without draft, read-only
- Limitations: single BO, no unmanaged, no actions/determinations/validations, no associations

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPWrite(create)` — create individual objects
- `SAPActivate` — activate
- `mcp-sap-docs` — RAP patterns and best practices
- LLM orchestrates multi-object creation
- Skill needed: `generate-rap-service` (comprehensive RAP service generator)

**Coverage: ⚠️ Partially covered** — ARC-1 can create objects individually, but no orchestrated RAP service generation skill exists yet. This is a high-value skill to create.

### 9. RAP Business Logic Prediction

**What it does:**
- Generates implementation code for RAP determinations and validations
- Triggered via Quick Fix (Ctrl+1) on empty method implementation
- Input: natural language description of what the determination/validation should do
- Output: complete method implementation inserted into editor

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPRead(BDEF, ...)` — read behavior definition
- `SAPRead(CLAS, ...)` — read implementation class
- `SAPWrite(edit_method)` — surgical method replacement
- `mcp-sap-docs` — RAP patterns
- Skill: part of `generate-abap-code` skill or dedicated `generate-rap-logic` skill

**Coverage: ✅ Achievable** — the building blocks exist. LLM + RAP docs + method surgery = equivalent capability.

### 10. Custom Code Migration AI Assistant

**What it does:**
- Explains ATC findings from S/4HANA readiness checks
- Explains simplification items and their impact on custom code
- Generates code proposals for findings (Apply/Insert/Copy)
- Quick Assist integration for inline code proposals
- Answers questions about data model changes, deprecated functionality, incompatible changes
- In-app support via Analyze Custom Code/Custom Code Migration app

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPDiagnose(atc)` — run ATC checks (including S/4HANA readiness variants)
- `SAPRead` — read affected code
- `mcp-sap-docs` — look up simplification notes and migration guides
- `SAPWrite` — apply fixes
- Skill needed: `migrate-custom-code` (CCM-focused skill)

**Coverage: ⚠️ Partially covered** — ATC findings + code read/write works. Missing: structured simplification item lookup, readiness check variant configuration. High-value skill for enterprises.

### 11. Embedded Analytics Star Schema Generator

**What it does:**
- Creates analytical star schema from CDS view entity
- Generates: cube definition, dimension views, measure fields
- Wizard-driven with AI-suggested structure
- Generates proper `@Analytics.dataCategory: #CUBE` annotations

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- `SAPRead(DDLS, ...)` — read source CDS entity
- `SAPWrite(create)` — create analytical CDS views
- `mcp-sap-docs` — embedded analytics documentation
- Skill needed: `generate-analytics-star-schema`

**Coverage: ⚠️ Partially covered** — building blocks exist but no dedicated skill.

### 12. GenAI-Driven Extensibility Assistant

**What it does:**
- Field extensibility tasks: creating custom fields
- Finding business contexts
- Finding value help views
- Finding usages
- Enabling business scenarios

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- This is heavily dependent on ABAP Cloud extensibility APIs
- `SAPSearch` — find objects
- `SAPRead` — read metadata
- Skill needed: `extensibility-assistant`

**Coverage: ❌ Not covered** — requires deep integration with ABAP Cloud extensibility framework APIs that ARC-1 does not currently expose.

### 13. ABAP AI SDK with ISLM

**What it does:**
- Provides an ABAP-side SDK for calling LLMs from within ABAP code
- Integrated with Intelligent Scenario Lifecycle Management (ISLM) for governance
- Enables ABAP developers to build AI-powered ABAP applications (not IDE tooling)
- Separate from J4D's IDE capabilities — this is about **consuming AI from ABAP runtime**

**ARC-1 + Skills equivalent:**
- **Not applicable** — this is an ABAP runtime capability, not a development tool
- Different scope: ARC-1 helps developers *write* ABAP; ABAP AI SDK helps ABAP *call* LLMs

**Coverage: ❌ N/A** — out of scope. Different problem domain entirely.
