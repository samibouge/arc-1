# fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt — Commit & Issue Tracker

> Tracking commits and issues from [fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt](https://github.com/fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt) for features worth adopting in ARC-1.

_Last updated: 2026-04-02_

## Approach

- **Commits**: Grouped by release in `commits.json`. Auto-triaged by commit prefix:
  - `feat:` → needs evaluation (pending)
  - `fix:` with SAP/ADT relevance → check
  - `chore:/docs:/test:/style:/ci:` → skipped
- **Issues**: All 33 issues evaluated in `issues.json` with relevance to ARC-1
- **Evaluations**: Detailed write-ups only for high/medium priority items in `evaluations/`
- **Scope**: Tracking from v2.4.0 (2026-02-15) onwards — earlier commits are scaffolding/refactoring

## Stats

| Metric | Commits | Issues |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Total | 765 | 33 |
| Tracked | 48 | 33 |
| Evaluated | 26 | 33 |
| Pending evaluation | 0 | 0 |
| Skipped (not relevant) | 22 | 20 |
| Evaluation files | 17 | 10 |

## Priority Summary

### High Priority (implement in ARC-1)

| Source | ID | Description | ARC-1 Matrix Ref |
|--------|----|-------------|-------------------|
| commit | TLS cluster (5 commits) | HTTPS/TLS for HTTP Streamable transport | Critical #5 |
| issue | #22, #23, #25 | 415 Content-Type auto-retry / Accept negotiation | Critical #3 |
| issue | #26 | TLS/HTTPS implementation reference | Critical #5 |

### Medium Priority (evaluate for adoption)

| Source | ID | Description | ARC-1 Matrix Ref |
|--------|----|-------------|-------------------|
| commit | 459f961 | Dump lookup by datetime+user, structured dump list | Enhance SAPDiagnose |
| commit | e5628dc | Read handlers returning source + metadata together | UX improvement |
| commit | 9ef5843 | Create vs Update separation (breaking change) | SAPWrite design |
| commit | available_in cluster | Dynamic tool hiding by system capabilities | features.ts enhancement |
| commit | 5f975fe | MCP client auto-configurator | High #21 in matrix |
| issue | #30 | Object history + transport contents | Medium #20, #25 in matrix |
| issue | #13 | i18n check handling for non-EN languages | Verify in ARC-1 |
| issue | #7, #6 | 409 error detail extraction for LLM | Verify in ARC-1 |

### Low / Skip (no action needed)

- RFC connectivity (ARC-1 is HTTP-only)
- RAG tool descriptions (ARC-1 uses intent routing)
- SSE transport (not in scope)
- Compact mode (ARC-1 has hyperfocused)
- Health endpoint (ARC-1 already has)
- YAML config (ARC-1 uses env vars)
- Legacy system support (ARC-1 targets 7.50+)

## How to Update

Run `/update-fr0ster-tracker` from Claude Code. This will:
1. Fetch new commits since `lastCheckedSha` in `commits.json`
2. Fetch new/updated issues since `lastUpdated` date
3. Auto-triage, evaluate, and create evaluation files for high/medium items
4. Update all related documents (this file, `05-fr0ster-mcp-abap-adt.md`, `00-feature-matrix.md`)

## Relationship to Existing Analysis

This tracker **complements** [../05-fr0ster-mcp-abap-adt.md](../05-fr0ster-mcp-abap-adt.md) which has:
- High-level project comparison
- Feature gap analysis (what they have vs ARC-1)
- Changelog & Relevance Tracker (release-level)

This folder provides **commit-level granularity** for specific implementation decisions and patterns worth studying.
