# Connecting to SAP BTP ABAP Environment via ADT API

**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Last updated:** 2026-04-01
**Status:** Implemented and tested — OAuth auth, system detection, tool adaptation, deployment docs
**PR:** #18 (`feat/btp-abap-direct-oauth-v2`)

## Executive Summary

The ADT API (`/sap/bc/adt/*`) is fully available on BTP ABAP Environment (Steampunk). Two major differences from on-premise: **authentication** (OAuth 2.0 via XSUAA instead of Basic Auth) and **available capabilities** (restricted ABAP language, no classic programs, limited table access).

ARC-1 now has full BTP ABAP support across three areas:

1. **Authentication** — Service key + OAuth Authorization Code flow (browser login) for local development. See [BTP ABAP Environment Setup](../btp-abap-environment.md).
2. **System detection** — Auto-detects BTP vs on-premise from SAP_CLOUD component (zero extra HTTP calls), with `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE` manual override.
3. **Tool adaptation** — Dynamic tool descriptions, type filtering, and helpful error messages tailored to BTP constraints.

## 1. Is ADT API Available on BTP ABAP Systems?

**Yes.** The same `/sap/bc/adt/*` endpoints are exposed. Eclipse ADT connects to BTP ABAP systems using these endpoints. The system URL comes from a **service key** created in the BTP Cockpit, and `/sap/bc/adt/` paths are appended to that base URL.

The service key JSON structure:

```json
{
  "uaa": {
    "clientid": "sb-<guid>!...",
    "clientsecret": "<secret>",
    "url": "https://<subdomain>.authentication.<region>.hana.ondemand.com",
    "identityzone": "<subdomain>",
    "tenantid": "<guid>"
  },
  "url": "https://<system-id>.abap.<region>.hana.ondemand.com",
  "catalogs": {
    "abap": { "path": "/sap/bc/adt", "type": "sap_abap" }
  }
}
```

Key fields:
- `url` — The ABAP system base URL (where ADT endpoints live)
- `uaa.url` — The XSUAA token endpoint (append `/oauth/token`)
- `uaa.clientid` / `uaa.clientsecret` — OAuth client credentials

---

## 2. Authentication — Authorization Code Flow (Recommended)

BTP ABAP Environment uses **OAuth 2.0 via XSUAA**. Basic Auth (username/password) is **NOT natively supported**.

The **Authorization Code** grant is the recommended flow. This is the same flow you see when Eclipse ADT opens a browser for login. Client Credentials (technical user) is not recommended — it restricts access more than it enables, and doesn't map to a real SAP user.

### How the Browser Login Works

1. MCP server starts a local HTTP callback listener (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/callback`)
2. Opens browser to XSUAA authorization endpoint:
   ```
   https://<subdomain>.authentication.<region>.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/authorize
     ?client_id=<clientid>
     &redirect_uri=http://localhost:3001/callback
     &response_type=code
   ```
3. User authenticates in the browser (SAP IdP, IAS, Azure AD, etc.)
4. Browser redirects to callback with an authorization code
5. Server exchanges code for JWT access token + refresh token:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST \
     "https://<subdomain>.authentication.<region>.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token" \
     -u "<clientid>:<clientsecret>" \
     -d "grant_type=authorization_code&code=<code>&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3001/callback"
   ```
6. Use `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on all ADT requests
7. When access token expires (~12h), use refresh token to get a new one — no browser needed again

### How the Browser Flow Works per MCP Transport

The browser behavior is **different depending on how ARC-1 runs**:

#### stdio mode (Claude Desktop, VS Code, Claude Code — local)

- The MCP protocol spec says stdio servers **SHOULD NOT** use MCP's built-in OAuth. Auth is handled outside the protocol.
- **fr0ster's approach (recommended for ARC-1):**
  1. Server starts, reads service key file
  2. If no cached token exists, server opens the user's **default browser** directly (e.g., `open` on macOS)
  3. User logs in via browser
  4. Local callback server on `localhost:<port>` captures the authorization code
  5. Token is cached to disk → next time, no browser needed
- The MCP client (Claude Desktop etc.) is NOT involved in the auth — the server handles it independently
- Default callback ports in fr0ster: stdio=4001, HTTP=5000, SSE=4000

#### HTTP transport (deployed server, multi-user)

Two options:

**Option A: MCP-native OAuth (spec-compliant)**
- MCP spec (2025-03-26) defines built-in OAuth 2.1 support for HTTP transport
- Server returns **HTTP 401** + `WWW-Authenticate` header pointing to metadata
- The **MCP client** (VS Code, Claude Desktop) opens the browser, not the server
- Client handles the full OAuth dance and attaches `Authorization: Bearer` to requests
- ARC-1 already has OIDC validation in `src/server/http.ts` — could be extended to point at XSUAA
- VS Code, Claude Desktop, and Claude Code all support this flow (with some quirks)

**Option B: Pre-authenticated token via header (simpler)**
- User obtains a JWT token externally (e.g., via a login page, CLI tool)
- Passes it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header or custom header like `x-sap-jwt-token`
- ARC-1 validates the JWT and uses it for SAP requests
- This is what fr0ster supports via `x-sap-destination` header routing

### MCP Client Behavior for OAuth

| MCP Client | Browser Auth Support | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **VS Code (Copilot Chat)** | Yes — opens browser automatically | Uses localhost callback URI |
| **Claude Desktop** | Yes — opens browser | Uses `claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback` redirect; some reported issues post Dec 2025 |
| **Claude Code (CLI)** | Yes — opens browser | Random port for callback; `--callback-port` to fix it |
| **Cursor** | Partial | May need manual token setup |

---

## 3. CSRF Token Handling

**Identical to on-premise.** Send `X-CSRF-Token: fetch` on a GET/HEAD request, extract the token from the response header, include it on subsequent POST/PUT/DELETE requests. Session cookies must be preserved.

---

## 4. Constraints vs On-Premise

| Area | Constraint |
|---|---|
| **ABAP Language** | Restricted ABAP ("ABAP for Cloud Development") — no dynpros, no reports, no unreleased SAP objects |
| **Released APIs only** | Only C1-released objects accessible; most standard SAP tables not directly queryable |
| **No SAP GUI** | Only ADT (Eclipse/API) available |
| **No direct DB table preview** | Data preview of database tables blocked by BTP backend policies |
| **No Basic Auth** | Must use OAuth 2.0; Basic Auth only via Communication Arrangements |
| **Package restrictions** | Custom development in `Z*` or customer namespace only |
| **Transport system** | Uses gCTS (Git-enabled CTS) or software components instead of traditional transport requests |
| **No OS-level access** | No file system, no SM51/SM66, no classic basis transactions |
| **Communication Scenarios** | Inbound API access may require explicit Communication Arrangements |

### Impact on ARC-1 Tools

| ARC-1 Tool | Impact |
|---|---|
| SAPRead | Works — source code, object metadata are accessible |
| SAPSearch | Works — object search endpoints available |
| SAPWrite | Works — but only for C1-released object types in customer namespace |
| SAPActivate | Works — activation endpoints available |
| SAPQuery | **Limited** — RunQuery (free SQL) likely blocked; CDS views work |
| SAPTransport | **Different** — gCTS instead of classic CTS; API may differ |
| SAPLint | Works — abaplint is client-side |
| SAPContext | Works — reads source code |
| SAPDiagnose | Works — ATC checks available (may need Communication Arrangement SAP_COM_0763) |

## 5. How Competitor Projects Handle Direct BTP ABAP Connection

### Overview

| Project | BTP ABAP Auth | Primary Flow | Uses SAML? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt** | Service key + browser OAuth2 | Authorization Code | No (SAML providers exist but for edge cases) |
| **aws-abap-accelerator** | Basic Auth (dev) / X.509 certs (enterprise) | Certificate-based PP | No (SAML provider is a stub) |
| **abap-adt-api (npm)** | BearerFetcher callback | Any (caller provides token) | No |
| **ARC-1 (current)** | Service key + browser OAuth2 | Authorization Code | No |

**Neither fr0ster nor AWS use SAML as their primary BTP auth flow.** Both have SAML providers but they are secondary/incomplete.

---

### fr0ster/mcp-abap-adt — Service Key + Authorization Code (Most Relevant)

This is the closest model for ARC-1's direct BTP ABAP support.

**Setup:**
1. User downloads service key JSON from BTP Cockpit
2. Places it at `~/.config/mcp-abap-adt/service-keys/<DESTINATION_NAME>.json`
3. Starts server with `--mcp=<DESTINATION_NAME>`

**Service key structure used:**
```json
{
  "uaa": {
    "clientid": "sb-abap-trial-...",
    "clientsecret": "...",
    "url": "https://account.authentication.eu10.hana.ondemand.com"
  },
  "abap": {
    "url": "https://account.abap.cloud.sap",
    "sapClient": "100"
  },
  "binding": { "env": "cloud", "type": "abap-cloud" }
}
```

**Auth flow:**
1. `AuthBroker` loads service key, extracts UAA credentials
2. Checks session cache (`~/.config/mcp-abap-adt/sessions/<DEST>.env`) for existing tokens
3. If no cached token → `AuthorizationCodeProvider` opens browser to XSUAA authorize endpoint
4. User authenticates in browser
5. Local callback server (`localhost:3001`) captures authorization code
6. Code exchanged for JWT access + refresh tokens
7. Tokens cached to disk for reuse across sessions
8. `Authorization: Bearer <token>` sent on all ADT requests
9. On 401/403: automatic token refresh via refresh token, then retry

**Architecture (multi-package):**
```
@mcp-abap-adt/auth-stores      → Reads service key files
@mcp-abap-adt/auth-providers   → 9 token providers (Authorization Code is primary for BTP)
@mcp-abap-adt/auth-broker      → Orchestrates: cache → refresh → browser flow
@mcp-abap-adt/connection       → HTTP transport, injects Bearer token + CSRF
```

**Key takeaway:** The complexity is in token lifecycle (acquire → cache → refresh → retry), not in the auth protocol itself. The actual OAuth exchange is straightforward.

### AWS ABAP Accelerator — Basic Auth + X.509 Certificates

**Development mode:** Standard Basic Auth (`SAP_USERNAME` + `SAP_PASSWORD`). Same as on-premise.

**Enterprise mode (ECS Fargate):**
1. User authenticates to MCP server via OAuth (AWS Cognito, Okta, Entra ID)
2. MCP server middleware extracts user identity from OAuth JWT
3. Generates **ephemeral X.509 certificate** (5-min RSA 2048-bit) with user's login as CN
4. Certificate signed by CA stored in AWS Secrets Manager
5. Certificate used to authenticate to SAP BTP ABAP via client cert auth
6. SAP CERTRULE maps certificate CN → SAP user

**Key difference:** This separates MCP auth (OAuth) from SAP auth (X.509 certs). It does NOT use XSUAA OAuth tokens to call ADT. It uses certificates instead.

**Not practical for ARC-1** — requires AWS infrastructure (Secrets Manager, IAM), CA certificate management, and SAP CERTRULE configuration.

---

### abap-adt-api (npm library) — BearerFetcher Pattern

The simplest integration pattern. The library accepts either a password string or a token-fetching function:

```typescript
// On-premise: Basic Auth
const client = new ADTClient("http://host:8000", "user", "password");

// BTP: OAuth Bearer token — caller provides the token
const client = new ADTClient(
  "https://<system-id>.abap.<region>.hana.ondemand.com",
  "user@domain.com",
  async () => {
    // Your function that obtains/refreshes OAuth token
    const token = await fetchOAuthToken(clientId, clientSecret, tokenUrl);
    return token;
  }
);
```

When the third parameter is a function (`BearerFetcher`), the library uses `Authorization: Bearer <token>` instead of Basic Auth. The caller is responsible for token lifecycle.

**Most relevant pattern for ARC-1** — minimal change to `AdtHttpClient`: accept a bearer token provider function alongside username/password.

---

## 6. ARC-1 Implementation — OAuth + Auth (Completed)

### What Was Added

1. **`src/adt/oauth.ts`** — New OAuth 2.0 module:
   - Service key parsing and validation (`parseServiceKey`, `loadServiceKeyFile`, `resolveServiceKey`)
   - Browser Authorization Code flow (`performBrowserLogin`, `startCallbackServer`, `openBrowser`)
   - Token exchange and refresh (`exchangeCodeForToken`, `refreshAccessToken`)
   - BearerFetcher pattern (`createBearerTokenProvider`) — caches token, auto-refreshes, re-authenticates

2. **`src/adt/http.ts`** — Bearer token support:
   - `bearerTokenProvider?: () => Promise<string>` in `AdtHttpConfig`
   - Injected on every request + CSRF token fetch (replaces Basic Auth when set)

3. **`src/server/server.ts`** — Startup wiring:
   - If `btpServiceKey` or `btpServiceKeyFile` is configured, resolves the service key
   - Overrides `config.url` and `config.client` from service key
   - Creates `bearerTokenProvider` and passes to `AdtClient`

### What Still Exists (On-Premise BTP Path)

The existing `src/adt/btp.ts` Destination Service path is unchanged and still works for on-premise connectivity via Cloud Connector. The two paths are independent — service key is for direct BTP ABAP, Destination Service is for on-premise via BTP.

---

## 7. ARC-1 Implementation — System Detection + Tool Adaptation (Completed)

### 7.1 System Type Detection

**Problem:** BTP ABAP has different capabilities from on-premise. Without detection, tools show wrong descriptions (e.g., suggesting `PROG` or `DD02L` which don't work on BTP) and return cryptic SAP errors.

**Solution:** Auto-detect BTP from the `SAP_CLOUD` component in `/sap/bc/adt/system/components` (already called for ABAP release detection — zero extra HTTP calls). Manual override via `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE=btp|onprem|auto`.

**Implementation in `src/adt/features.ts`:**

```typescript
export function detectSystemType(
  components: Array<{ name: string; release: string; description: string }>,
): SystemType {
  const hasSapCloud = components.some((c) => c.name.toUpperCase() === 'SAP_CLOUD');
  return hasSapCloud ? 'btp' : 'onprem';
}
```

Called from `probeFeatures()` which accepts a `systemTypeOverride` parameter. When `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE` is set explicitly (not `auto`), the override is used without probing.

**Why this matters for tool definitions at startup:** `getToolDefinitions()` is called at server startup before the first probe. Setting `SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE=btp` ensures correct tool definitions from the first request. With `auto`, tools start with on-prem defaults and adapt after the first `SAPManage probe` call.

### 7.2 Tool Description Adaptation

**Problem:** LLMs choose tools based on descriptions. If SAPRead says "read a program (PROG)" on BTP, the LLM will try it, get a cryptic error, and waste tokens retrying.

**Solution:** Dynamic `getToolDefinitions(config)` with BTP-specific variants for all 11 tools.

**Key changes on BTP:**

| Tool | What changes |
|------|-------------|
| **SAPRead** | Removes PROG, INCL, VIEW, TEXT_ELEMENTS, VARIANTS, SOBJ from type enum. Returns helpful error if LLM tries them anyway. |
| **SAPWrite** | Only CLAS, INTF. Must use ABAP Cloud syntax, Z/Y namespace. |
| **SAPQuery** | Warns that SAP standard tables (DD02L, TADIR, etc.) are blocked. Suggests CDS views. |
| **SAPSearch** | Notes that only released and custom objects are returned. |
| **SAPTransport** | Explains gCTS: release = Git push, not TMS export. |
| **SAPContext** | Only CLAS, INTF. Includes released SAP objects (they're the dev API surface on BTP). |
| **SAPManage** | Returns `systemType` in probe results. |
| **SAPActivate** | No change. |
| **SAPNavigate** | Notes released object scope. |
| **SAPLint** | No change (client-side). |
| **SAPDiagnose** | No change. |

### 7.3 Handler Behavior Adaptation

**Problem:** Even with adapted descriptions, LLMs sometimes try unavailable operations. BTP ABAP returns generic HTTP 400/404 errors that don't explain *why* something failed.

**Solution:** `BTP_HINTS` map in `intent.ts` catches known-unavailable operations before they hit SAP and returns actionable guidance:

```typescript
const BTP_HINTS: Record<string, string> = {
  PROG: 'Executable programs (reports) are not available on BTP ABAP Environment. Use CLAS with IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN for console applications.',
  INCL: 'Includes are not available on BTP ABAP Environment. Use private methods in classes instead.',
  VIEW: 'Classic DDIC views are not available on BTP ABAP Environment. Use DDLS (CDS views) instead.',
  // ... etc.
};
```

**Design decision:** We intercept at the handler level (before hitting SAP) for known-unavailable object types. For table queries, we rely on the adapted SAPQuery description (which warns about blocked SAP standard tables and suggests CDS views) rather than trying to parse SQL and guess which tables are blocked — regex-based SQL parsing is error-prone and the set of blocked tables varies by system.

### 7.4 Architecture Decision: One Instance Per SAP System

**Decision:** Each ARC-1 deployment connects to exactly one SAP backend. Multiple users share the same instance via principal propagation (on-premise) or JWT Bearer Exchange (BTP).

**Why not multi-backend gateway?**

| Concern | One-per-system | Multi-backend gateway |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| Security | Blast radius = one system | One breach = all systems |
| Auth | Clean: one auth flow per instance | N destinations + N auth flows |
| Safety gates | Per-system: `readOnly`, `allowedOps`, `allowedPackages` | Can't vary per backend |
| Tool descriptions | Tailored to system type (BTP vs on-premise) | Must be generic for all |
| Scaling | Scale independently | Heavy-use system affects all |

This is the same model used by Eclipse ADT, SAP Business Application Studio, and SAP GUI. The LLM sees separate tool sets from each MCP server and picks the right one.

## 8. ARC-1 Usage — See Setup Guide

For end-to-end setup instructions, see **[docs/btp-abap-environment.md](../btp-abap-environment.md)**.

Quick start (local dev):
```bash
SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY_FILE=/path/to/service-key.json SAP_SYSTEM_TYPE=btp arc1
```

For deployment to BTP Cloud Foundry, see:
- [deployment-best-practices.md](../deployment-best-practices.md) — Architecture, config, key files
- [phase4-btp-deployment.md](../phase4-btp-deployment.md) — Step-by-step CF deployment (Docker + nodejs_buildpack)
- `manifest-btp-abap.yml` — CF manifest template for BTP ABAP

---

## 9. Required Communication Arrangements

For programmatic access to BTP ABAP Environment, certain Communication Arrangements may be needed:

| Scenario | ID | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| ADT Core | (built-in) | Basic ADT access — typically available by default |
| ATC Checks | SAP_COM_0763 | Run ATC checks programmatically |
| Custom Communication Scenario | Custom | For specific inbound API access patterns |

Communication Arrangement setup:
1. Create a Communication System (pointing to your MCP server / external caller)
2. Create a Communication User (technical user with required authorizations)
3. Create a Communication Arrangement binding scenario + system + user

---

## 10. Deferred: JWT Bearer Exchange + CI/CD Auth

### JWT Bearer Exchange (CF Deployed → BTP ABAP, Multi-User)

**Status:** Deferred — low priority, can be a separate PR if demand arises.

**What it would do:** When ARC-1 runs as a deployed CF app serving multiple developers, each developer's MCP client authenticates via XSUAA. The MCP server would exchange that user's JWT for a BTP ABAP-scoped token via `jwt-bearer` grant, then call ADT as that specific user.

**Why deferred:**

1. **BTP ABAP adoption is still niche** — most SAP customers are on-premise S/4 or ECC. The on-premise flow via Cloud Connector + Principal Propagation already works.
2. **The developer scenario already works** — local dev with `SAP_BTP_SERVICE_KEY_FILE` + browser OAuth is the realistic first touchpoint. That's implemented.
3. **The multi-user deployed BTP ABAP scenario is rare** — very few orgs currently have (a) a CF-deployed MCP server AND (b) BTP ABAP Environment AND (c) need per-user identity propagation to it. Most BTP ABAP users would use the local dev flow.
4. **A technical user workaround exists** — for the few who deploy on CF connecting to BTP ABAP, a shared service key (single technical user) works today. Not ideal for audit trails, but functional.
5. **Complex to implement and test correctly** — requires XSUAA token exchange grant type config, proper service bindings, and a real multi-user BTP setup to verify.

**If implemented later, it would touch:**
- `src/adt/oauth.ts` — Add `jwtBearerExchange()` function
- `src/server/server.ts` — Wire up per-request token exchange
- `src/server/http.ts` — Extract user JWT from MCP request

### CI/CD Communication User Auth

**Status:** Deferred — separate use case, not part of the interactive MCP flow.

**What it would do:** Allow non-interactive (CI/CD) access to BTP ABAP via Communication Arrangements. A Communication User with `SAP_COM_0901` (ATC checks) or `SAP_COM_0735` (unit tests) would authenticate via Client Credentials grant.

**Why deferred:**
- CI/CD is a different use case from interactive MCP (LLM + developer)
- Requires specific Communication Arrangement setup per scenario
- Client Credentials returns a technical token that works for specific APIs but not general ADT access
- Could be a separate tool or mode rather than part of the core MCP server

### Future Possibilities

| Feature | Effort | Value | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| JWT Bearer Exchange | Medium | Low (few users today) | Enables deployed multi-user → BTP ABAP |
| Communication User auth | Small | Low (CI/CD only) | For ATC/unit test automation |
| X.509 certificate auth | Large | Low (enterprise niche) | mTLS for token exchange |
| MCP-native OAuth for BTP ABAP | Medium | Medium | Let MCP client handle the full OAuth dance against XSUAA |
| Multi-system tool routing | Large | Medium | Single MCP server, multiple backends (decided against — see one-per-system architecture) |
