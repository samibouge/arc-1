# ralphex Plan Creator

Generate a structured implementation plan for the ralphex autonomous coding agent. The plan must be detailed enough for an autonomous agent (Claude Code) to execute each task without human guidance, in isolated sessions with fresh context.

## Input

The user provides a feature/task description. This can be:
- A free-form description ("add caching for ADT responses")
- A reference to a gap analysis or roadmap item
- A GitHub issue
- A detailed requirements brief

If the description is vague, ask 1-2 targeted clarifying questions before proceeding. Don't over-interview — get enough to start researching.

---

## Phase 1: Deep Research

Before writing a single line of the plan, research exhaustively. ralphex tasks execute in isolated Claude Code sessions with **no shared context** — every task must be self-contained. The quality of your research directly determines whether the autonomous agent succeeds or gets stuck.

### 1a. Read project guidelines

Read `CLAUDE.md` in full. Pay attention to:
- Codebase structure (the file tree)
- Key Files for Common Tasks table
- Code patterns (ADT client method, handler pattern, safety check)
- Testing conventions (vitest, mock patterns, fixture locations)
- Technology stack
- Configuration options (the config table — new features may need new flags)

### 1b. Read infrastructure docs

Read `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` for context on the test system:
- SAP A4H system details (host, ports, credentials pattern)
- BTP deployment details
- How to run integration/smoke tests against the live system
- PP (Principal Propagation) setup if auth-related

### 1c. Map the affected code

Based on the feature description, identify ALL files that will need changes. For each file:
- Read the current implementation
- Note line numbers for key sections
- Understand the patterns used

Use the "Key Files for Common Tasks" table in CLAUDE.md as a starting point, then trace the call chain to find additional files.

### 1d. Read existing tests

For every source file you plan to modify, find and read its test counterpart:
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/` (mirror source structure)
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` if applicable
- Fixtures in `tests/fixtures/xml/` and `tests/fixtures/abap/`
- Understand mocking patterns: `vi.mock('undici', ...)` + `mockResponse()`

### 1e. Check for prior art

Search the codebase for similar patterns. If the feature extends an existing pattern, identify it to ensure consistency. Also check:
- `docs/plans/completed/` — similar completed plans for format reference
- `docs/research/` — existing research documents
- `docs/plans/` — in-progress plans to avoid conflicts

### 1e2. Audit documentation, roadmap, feature matrix & skills

Every feature plan must account for the full artifact surface. Research what needs updating:

**Internal technical documentation (`docs/`)**
Read the docs that relate to the feature area. Key files include:
- `docs/tools.md` — tool reference (update if adding/changing tool operations or parameters)
- `docs/authorization.md` — auth model (update if changing safety, scopes, or auth behavior)
- `docs/security-guide.md` — security practices (update if changing security posture)
- `docs/caching.md` — caching architecture (update if touching cache layer)
- `docs/architecture.md` — architecture overview (update if changing request flow or major components)
- `docs/cli-guide.md` — CLI reference (update if adding new flags/env vars)
- `docs/setup-guide.md`, `docs/docker.md`, `docs/btp-abap-environment.md`, `docs/enterprise-auth.md` — deployment docs (update if changing config or deployment behavior)
- `CLAUDE.md` — AI assistant guidelines (update Key Files table, config table, codebase structure tree, code patterns — this is critical since autonomous agents depend on it)

While reviewing each doc, note anything that is **outdated or missing** even if unrelated to the current feature — flag these as bonus fix items.

**End-user documentation (`README.md`, `docs/index.md`)**
Read `README.md` and `docs/index.md`. Check whether:
- Feature highlights or capability lists need updating
- Quick start or client config examples need changes
- The feature table / badge section reflects the new capability

**Roadmap (`docs/roadmap.md`)**
Read `docs/roadmap.md`. Check whether:
- The feature corresponds to an existing roadmap item (update status to "completed" or "in progress")
- A new roadmap entry is needed
- The "Current State" feature matrix at the top needs a new row
- Any related items should be marked as unblocked or superseded

**Feature matrix (`compare/00-feature-matrix.md`)**
Read `compare/00-feature-matrix.md`. Check whether:
- The feature adds a new capability that should appear in the comparison matrix
- An existing row needs its status updated (e.g., from ❌ to ✅)
- The "Last Updated" date should be refreshed

**Skills (`.claude/commands/*.md`)**
Read all skill files in `.claude/commands/`. Check whether:
- Any existing skill can leverage the new feature (e.g., a new ADT operation that `explain-abap-code.md` or `implement-feature.md` could use)
- A skill's instructions reference behavior that the feature changes (update the skill)
- A new skill is warranted for the feature
- Existing skills have outdated references to tool names, parameters, or workflows

### 1f. SAP-specific research (when needed)

If the feature involves SAP-specific concepts (ADT APIs, authorization objects, BTP services, ABAP language features), use available MCP tools:
- `sap-docs` MCP tools — search SAP documentation, discovery center, community
- `sap-notes` MCP tools — search SAP Notes for known issues, corrections, recommendations
- Only use these when the feature genuinely requires SAP domain knowledge (new ADT endpoints, auth objects, BTP service configuration, etc.)

### 1g. Summarize findings

Before writing the plan, organize your findings:
- **Affected files** (source + test + config + docs + skills)
- **Existing patterns** to follow (with file:line references)
- **Dependencies** between changes
- **Security/safety considerations**
- **Test strategy** (what to test, how to test it — unit, integration, and E2E)
- **Documentation updates** (which docs, roadmap entries, feature matrix rows, skills)
- **Outdated docs spotted** (anything stale you noticed during research, even if unrelated)

---

## Phase 2: Write the Plan

Write the plan to `docs/plans/<descriptive-name>.md`. The filename should be kebab-case and describe the feature (e.g., `add-cache-warmup.md`, `authorization-roles-scopes.md`).

### Plan Structure

The plan MUST follow this exact structure for ralphex compatibility:

```markdown
# <Title>

## Overview

<1-3 paragraphs: what this plan does, why, and key design decisions>

## Context

### Current State
<What exists today, what's missing or broken>

### Target State
<What the end result looks like>

### Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/...` | Description of what this file does |

### Design Principles
<Numbered list of architectural decisions and constraints>

## Development Approach

<Brief notes on testing approach, ordering, conventions>

## Validation Commands

- `npm test`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run lint`

### Task 1: <Descriptive title>

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/path/to/file.ts`
- Modify: `tests/unit/path/to/file.test.ts`

<1-2 sentences of context: what this task does and why>

- [ ] Step 1 description
- [ ] Step 2 description
- [ ] Add unit tests (~N tests): brief list of what to test
- [ ] Run `npm test` — all tests must pass

### Task 2: ...

### Task N: Final verification

- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test` — all tests pass
- [ ] Run typecheck: `npm run typecheck` — no errors
- [ ] Run lint: `npm run lint` — no errors
- [ ] <Feature-specific verification steps>
- [ ] Move this plan to `docs/plans/completed/`
```

### Critical ralphex Format Rules

These rules are non-negotiable — violating them causes ralphex to malfunction:

1. **Task headers MUST use `### Task N:` format** — ralphex detects tasks by this pattern. `N` can be integer or non-integer (2.5, 2a).

2. **Checkboxes (`- [ ]`) belong ONLY inside Task sections.** Never put checkboxes in Overview, Context, Design Principles, Development Approach, or any section outside `### Task N:`. Checkboxes outside tasks cause extra loop iterations.

3. **Include `## Validation Commands`** — ralphex runs these after each task. List the project's test/lint/typecheck commands.

4. **No checkboxes in Context or Overview** — even if listing requirements or design decisions, use plain bullets (`-`) not checkboxes (`- [ ]`).

5. **Each task must be self-contained** — ralphex executes each task in a fresh Claude Code session with no memory of previous tasks. Include enough context in each task for the agent to understand what to do without reading other tasks.

### Writing Effective Tasks

Each task runs in an isolated Claude Code session. The agent sees only the plan file and can read the codebase, but has NO context from previous task executions. Write tasks accordingly:

**DO:**
- Include file paths and line number references (e.g., "modify `isOperationAllowed()` at line ~95")
- Include the **Files:** block listing which files to modify/create
- Reference existing patterns by file and function name
- Include a "Run `npm test`" checkbox at the end of every task
- Include approximate test counts ("Add unit tests (~8 tests): ...")
- Describe the expected behavior, not just "implement X"
- Include context sentences explaining WHY this task exists

**DON'T:**
- Assume the agent knows what happened in previous tasks
- Use vague instructions ("update the tests accordingly")
- Skip test requirements — every task that changes code MUST include tests
- Create tasks that are too large (>10 checkboxes is a yellow flag, >15 is too many)
- Create tasks that are too small (a single checkbox task should be merged with an adjacent task)

### Task Ordering

Order tasks to minimize cross-task dependencies:
1. **Foundation first** — types, interfaces, core functions
2. **Wiring second** — connecting new code to existing infrastructure
3. **Config/CLI third** — new flags, env vars, profiles
4. **External config fourth** — xs-security.json, manifest.yml, etc.
5. **Tests fifth** — ensure unit tests cover the new code; add integration tests if the feature touches SAP system interaction; add E2E tests if the feature adds new tool operations or changes MCP protocol behavior (see "Test Requirements" below)
6. **Documentation sixth** — update all affected artifacts:
   - `CLAUDE.md` — codebase structure tree, Key Files table, config table, code patterns
   - Internal docs in `docs/` — tool reference, architecture, security, auth, caching, CLI guide, etc.
   - End-user docs — `README.md`, `docs/index.md`
   - `docs/roadmap.md` — mark items completed, add new entries, update current state matrix
   - `compare/00-feature-matrix.md` — add/update capability rows, refresh "Last Updated"
   - Skills in `.claude/commands/` — update existing skills that can leverage the feature, fix stale references
7. **Final verification last** — always the last task

### Test Requirements

Tests are critical. Every task that modifies code MUST include test checkboxes. Follow these patterns:

**Unit tests (`tests/unit/`, 57+ files, 700+ tests)**
- Mirror source structure under `tests/unit/` (e.g., `src/adt/client.ts` → `tests/unit/adt/client.test.ts`)
- Mock HTTP layer: `vi.mock('undici', ...)` with `mockResponse()` helper from `tests/helpers/mock-fetch.ts`
- XML fixtures: `tests/fixtures/xml/` for ADT response parsing
- ABAP fixtures: `tests/fixtures/abap/` for source parsing
- Config: `vitest.config.ts` (10s timeout, isolated modules)
- Run: `npm test`

**Integration tests (`tests/integration/`, 6 files)**
- Add tests when the feature touches SAP system interaction
- Auto-skipped when `TEST_SAP_URL` is not set — safe to add without breaking CI
- Use `getTestClient()` factory from `tests/integration/helpers.ts`
- Sequential execution (SAP session conflicts)
- Config: `vitest.integration.config.ts` (30s timeout)
- Run: `npm run test:integration`
- BTP-specific: `tests/integration/btp-abap.integration.test.ts` (local only, needs `TEST_BTP_SERVICE_KEY_FILE`)

**E2E tests (`tests/e2e/`, 6 files)**
- Add tests when the feature adds new tool operations or changes MCP protocol behavior
- Exercise the full MCP JSON-RPC stack via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` client
- Use helpers: `connectClient()`, `callTool()`, `expectToolSuccess()`, `expectToolError()` from `tests/e2e/helpers.ts`
- Test fixtures defined in `tests/e2e/fixtures.ts`, setup in `tests/e2e/setup.ts`
- Config: `tests/e2e/vitest.e2e.config.ts` (60s test timeout, 120s hook timeout)
- Run: `npm run test:e2e` (requires running MCP server at `E2E_MCP_URL`)
- Full cycle: `npm run test:e2e:full` (build + deploy + test + stop)

**The test system described in `INFRASTRUCTURE.md` can be used for smoke testing and creating test fixtures.**

**Deciding which test tiers to include:**
- Code-only changes (parsers, safety checks, config logic) → unit tests only
- New ADT endpoints or changed SAP interaction → unit tests + integration tests
- New/changed MCP tool operations → unit tests + E2E tests
- Auth or transport changes → unit tests + integration tests + E2E tests

---

## Phase 3: Review & Refine

Before presenting the plan:

1. **Re-read the plan as if you're an autonomous agent** — would you know exactly what to do for each task? Are file paths specific? Are patterns referenced?

2. **Check for missing dependencies** — does Task 3 assume something from Task 2 that isn't explicitly stated?

3. **Verify the format** — run a mental checklist:
   - `### Task N:` headers? Yes
   - Checkboxes only in Task sections? Yes
   - `## Validation Commands` present? Yes
   - Every code-changing task has test checkboxes? Yes
   - Final verification task exists? Yes

4. **Verify artifact coverage** — every plan must account for all affected artifacts:
   - [ ] **Tests**: Are the right test tiers included? (unit for all code changes, integration for SAP interaction, E2E for tool/protocol changes)
   - [ ] **Internal docs**: Does a task update relevant `docs/*.md` files? (`tools.md`, `authorization.md`, `security-guide.md`, `caching.md`, `architecture.md`, `cli-guide.md`, etc.)
   - [ ] **End-user docs**: Does a task update `README.md` and/or `docs/index.md` if the feature is user-visible?
   - [ ] **CLAUDE.md**: Does a task update the codebase structure tree, Key Files table, config table, or code patterns?
   - [ ] **Roadmap**: Does a task update `docs/roadmap.md` (mark completed, add entry, update current state)?
   - [ ] **Feature matrix**: Does a task update `compare/00-feature-matrix.md` if the feature adds a new capability?
   - [ ] **Skills**: Does a task update `.claude/commands/*.md` skills that reference changed behavior or could leverage the new feature?
   - [ ] **Outdated docs**: Are any stale docs spotted during research included as bonus fix items?

5. **Check total scope** — aim for 5-12 tasks. Fewer than 5 means tasks are too large. More than 12 means the feature should be split into multiple plans.
